  <p>Natalie woke purposefully and when she was done with her run-shower-dress, she went downstairs and made toast with eggs. She returned to the bedroom and approached Lottie at her vanity.</p>

  <p>“Breakfast is ready. Are you ready to eat?”</p>
  
  <p>“Almost.” She checked her watch. “We still have a lot of time. Why don’t you check our backpacks and pack the duffel for practice?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>She went to Lottie’s bag first. “Uh, Lot. You have a lot of stuff in here… what do you need?”</p>
  
  <p>“Today’s even so make sure the notebooks are for the classes for my even day. I keep my notebooks there.” She gestured to a drawer at the desk.” </p>
  
  <p>Nat followed her instructions and removed the 3 notebooks in the bag and replaced them with the notebooks in the drawer. She knew Lottie had Calculus for her sixth hour, and made sure to pack a calculator into the bag too. </p>
  
  <p>She went to her own backpack, packed the completed homework, then moved on to the duffel bag. She went into Lottie’s closet, retrieved the appropriate articles, and packed them neatly in the bag. </p>
  
  <p>Lottie watched as she took the bags and put them by the door. “Thank you Natalie.” She stood and gave her a kiss on the forehead. “Such a good girl.”</p>
  
  <p>The praise mixed with the feelings of competence and accomplishment in Nat and her heart raced with pride. She wanted more.</p>
  
  <p>“Are you ready for breakfast? I made eggs today.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh? Sounds delicious. Let’s eat.” </p>
  
  <p>Nat followed Lottie to the kitchen.</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>In English class, Natalie read from her <em> Poe </em> book until class began, and maintained an unbroken focus through the lecture. When the bell rang, she rose and waited for Lottie by the door. Lottie walked her to trig class and kissed her by the door. </p>
  
  <p>“I’ll see you after class.”</p>
  
  <p>“Bye Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat sat at her desk and reviewed her notes. When Van arrived she was all energy.</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Good morning </em>.” She nearly sang it.</p>
  
  <p>“Hi Van.” She smiled at her.</p>
  
  <p>Van looked at her friend and the organized notes in front of her. “I see everything is going according to the new normal. You’re early, you’re studying. Am I to assume everything is good with Lottie, then?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat stopped and turned to face Van behind her, “yeah actually. I, uh, asked her to be my girlfriend.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh shit, Nat!” She gave her friend a hardy slap on the shoulder. “Good job. I figure she said yes?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat could hardly speak through her smile. “Yeah, um… it’s really great. It feels so good.”</p>
  
  <p>“I bet. She’s super hot. Way to go, Nat. 10/10”. </p>
  
  <p>“She’s so fucking perfect, Van. I just… it’s so much more than that. It’s like she’s <em> everything </em>, y’know?”</p>
  
  <p>“Wow, dude. Um, yeah. I get it. That’s really cool. Maybe we can all go out soon, do like a double-date thing.”</p>
  
  <p>“Sure, Van. Thanks.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>At the end of the class, Nat rose purposefully and went towards Mr. DeMartino’s room to find Lottie. She found her quickly. </p>
  
  <p>“Hey Lot.” She stood and waited for her forehead kiss. When she got it, she continued. “I have one more lunch detention today.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie nodded. “Let’s try to make this the last one, hm?” She walked Nat to the library. “I’ll wait for you at Barch’s room after fourth hour, ok?”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok, Lot. I’ll see you later.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>At lunch detention she envisioned the lunches to come, to be spent with Lottie. Sitting with Lottie. Smoking with Lottie. <em> Lottie. </em>She smiled to herself.</p>
  
  <p>After computers, she all but ran to Ms. Barch’s room. She found Lottie standing outside, talking to Laura Lee. Nat approached them. “Hey Lot.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled at her, but forwent the forehead kiss. She continued with Laura Lee until she completed her thought. “Hi Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat stood expectantly. </p>
  
  <p>“Aren’t you going to say hi to Laura Lee?”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, uh, hi Laura Lee.”</p>
  
  <p>“Hi Nat!” Laura Lee’s friendliness stood in contrast to Lottie’s demeanor. “How’s it going?”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s good.” Nat turned back to Lottie. “Do you have calc now?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah we both do.” Laura Lee answered her. “Are you going to walk with us?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat kept her eyes on Lottie, silently consulting her. </p>
  
  <p>“Yes, she is. Come on, Nat.” Lottie started walking, and Nat followed a step behind.</p>
  
  <p>The class was nearby, and they only walked a short length down the hall, but Nat savored the time together. When they arrived, Lottie turned and kissed her forehead. “Thank you Nat. See you after class.” </p>
  
  <p>Nat turned to walk away, but Lottie stopped her. “Oh wait, Nat- one more thing.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah Lot?”</p>
  
  <p>“Please don’t interrupt my friends in the hall. I love it when you come find me, but make sure you’re polite. You should say hi to them, too.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. I will.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Nat went back to Barch’s room. She sat at her lab table with Misty.</p>
  
  <p>“Hi Natalie! So great you’re in class again.”</p>
  
  <p>“Hey Misty.”</p>
  
  <p>“Things must be really getting serious with Lottie, huh?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked up from her notes, surprised by the question from her. “What?”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, um, I just you know, saw you meet her here and then walk with her to class, like, 3 rooms away.”</p>
  
  <p>“Right”</p>
  
  <p>“Just seems like, you probably could’ve just kissed her and walked in the room, right?”</p>
  
  <p>“What do you know about it, Misty?</p>
  
  <p>Misty tried to backtrack. “Oh I don’t know anything Nat, seriously. It was just super cute, that’s all. Are you guys, like, official now?”</p>
  
  <p>“Mind your own business Misty.”</p>
  
  <p>Misty mimed as though she were zipping her mouth and throwing a key. “Haha mums the word!”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>After class, Nat found Lottie in the hall and walked with her and Laura Lee to the locker rooms. </p>
  
  <p>At practice, she never allowed a distance to grow between the two of them. She stayed close in drill queues, ran close in laps in sprints, and took positions opposite her in matchups. </p>
  
  <p>Lottie drove them home, and once there Nat went straight up to the desk and did her homework. She finished her only two assignments quickly and turned to face Lottie on the bed.</p>
  
  <p>“Are you almost done?”</p>
  
  <p>“No Natalie. I have a lot of work to do today. Are you finished?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>“Don’t make dinner yet. It’s too early and it’ll get cold.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok, Lottie. What should I do?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her. “Come here.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie rose and joined her on the bed. Lottie took her face in her hand and stroked her cheek. “Did you have a good day today?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat caught Lottie’s gaze and felt its warmth seep into her. “Yes, Lottie. It was good.”</p>
  
  <p>“I liked having you with me today. Between classes.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat’s heart sang. “I liked it too.”</p>
  
  <p>“Did you like it, sweetheart, letting me walk you through the halls?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. I liked letting you walk me.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s a good girl, hm?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. So good.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie brought her into a deep kiss. Nat took it like a blessing and savored the feeling of dizzy excitement that overwhelmed her.</p>
  
  <p>“Now, baby, I need you to wait for me to be finished with my work, ok?”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>“Go sit.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat nodded and rose. She went to her desk and sat down. She looked at Lottie. “Is this good?”</p>
  
  <p>“Very good.” </p>
  
  <p>“Thank you, Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>Nat sat eyes forward, gazing out the window. She felt at ease, relaxed, with Lottie’s words hanging in her mind. <em> Very good. </em></p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>When Lottie finished with her work she rose and went to stand behind Natalie at the desk. She bent and laid a trail of kisses and nips down her neck. “Mm, you looked so pretty sitting here, waiting for me. So good. You like being good for me, don’t you?”</p>
  
  <p>“Uhh… yes...” Nat’s head was swimming at the sensation of the contact after sitting without a thought for so long.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie spoke with a soft edge in her tone, now standing over Nat with her hands resting on her shoulders, “That’s yes or no Natalie. I don’t want to hear hesitation from you. Do you understand?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.” Nat was coming back to herself with the stimulation and conversation. Her head began to swim with concern over Lottie’s dissatisfaction. “I’m sorry Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s ok, baby. You just need to learn.” Natalie nodded. “What do you say?”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>“Very good.” Lottie kissed the top of Nat’s head. “Time for dinner.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>In the kitchen, Nat set the table while Lottie prepared the meal. When they sat, Nat waited for Lottie to signal the beginning of the meal.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at Natalie, nodded, and said, “Bon Appetit.” and they commenced.</p>
  
  <p>“How were your classes today, honey?” </p>
  
  <p>Nat smiled at the pet name. “They were good. Maybe a little boring… they’re going kind of slow.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie nodded in understanding. “Yes, regular classes can be that way. Probably if you weren’t out of absences you could afford to miss a class or two and still keep up ok.”</p>
  
  <p>At the mention of her truancy, Nat felt a wave of emotions was over her. It had started to feel like a lifetime ago, but still she felt guilty and dirty over her past bad behavior. She looked about the kitchen, and thought of the world of plenty she was in. The home, the consistency, the care, all in spades. She felt grateful for the life she had now, and felt grateful to Lottie. </p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at the girl with her at the table. “Yeah.” She searched for the place behind her eyes. “Lottie, thank you so much.”</p>
  
  <p>“For what, Natalie?”</p>
  
  <p>“You’ve done so much. I… feel like… I don’t know.” She searched for words that would describe the feeling of gratitude and devotion that ruled her. “You’ve done so much for me… I feel like… I could do anything for you, and it still wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s sweet of you, Natalie. I would do anything for you, too.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>They ate and took their cigarettes in comfortable silence as they let the rhythm of the day slow to stillness. </p>
  
  <p>As Natalie laid in her place, she let the sweeping gentleness of Lottie’s music massage her mind. She savored the sensation of the notes entering her, swirling about her insides, and then exiting with her soft, calm, breath.</p>
  
  <p>She replayed her day in her head, in an effort to relive the pleasures of it. She thought of packing Lottie’s bag for her and preparing their breakfast. She thought of meeting Lottie between classes and walking with her. She thought of how happy she was to not have to part with her during practice any longer, and how it meant they’d have an additional two hours together each day.</p>
  
  <p>“Lottie?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes Natalie?” She spoke as she played.</p>
  
  <p>“I had a really good day.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s wonderful, baby.”</p>
  
  <p>“Could we, um, go upstairs?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie stopped playing and looked at her watch. “I want to play for a little longer. But you may go. You may shower and wait for me.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat rose and went to the bedroom. She cleaned and dressed, and made an effort to neaten up the space on the bed Lottie had been working on. She smoothed the duvet and made the bed as inviting as possible, then sat in the middle, cross-legged, and waited.</p>
  
  <p>When Lottie came to the room she didn’t acknowledge her there. She went straight into the shower and emerged wrapped in a towel. She went to her closet, retrieved some clothes, and dressed near the foot of the bed so Nat could see. </p>
  
  <p>Nat’s eyes never left the brunette. She saw her skin was flushed from the shower’s heat, and saw her dark hair cling to her collarbones. Lottie unwrapped her towel without ceremony, unhurried, savoring the feeling of Nat’s eye’s on her. </p>
  
  <p>The soft cotton nightshirt she pulled over her head clung briefly to the shape of her body before settling. She slipped her panties up over her long legs, and sighed when they came in contact with her, cool against pooling heat. </p>
  
  <p>Her movements were ordinary, unperformed, and yet each one seemed to pull the connection Nat felt ever tighter. </p>
  
  <p>She turned her attention to Natalie and looked into her. “Come.” </p>
  
  <p>Nat felt herself move forward and sat at the edge of the bed.</p>
  
  <p>“Good girl,” purred Lottie, her voice a velvety whisper that seemed to settle directly into Nat’s bones. The words sent a shiver down her spine, and Nat felt a heady rush of warmth spread across her body as the fragrance of Lottie’s freshly showered surrounded her, thick and suffocating in the most delicious way. It enveloped her completely, leaving her breathless and dizzy, her pulse quickening.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie’s fingers slid gently under her chin, tilting her head back to press a deep, heavy kiss against her lips. Her tongue slid into Nat’s mouth with a slow, deliberate pace, and her breath caught as the kiss deepened. </p>
  
  <p>Then, before she could gather her bearings, Lottie bit down on her bottom lip, pulling away with a teasing smile. Nat didn’t even have a moment to respond, her brain still reeling from the kiss, from the sensation, but Lottie was staring into her again, leaving her dazed and struggling for awareness.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m gonna make you feel so good, my pretty pet.” </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Feel so good.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>“That’s right. Now, I want you to undress for me.” She took her shirt delicately in her hand. “Take this off.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat nodded and complied.</p>
  
  <p>“These too.” She tugged at her underwear.</p>
  
  <p>Nat stepped out of them. She stood in front of Lottie, bare.</p>
  
  <p>“Very good. Good girl.” Lottie ran her finger tip along Nat’s pale skin, starting at her collarbone and tracing a gentle line between her breasts and over her taut stomach.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie was only half conscious, dazed and alight. <b>“Good.” </b>She felt the arousal mounting low in her and double over as the words passed over her lips.</p>
  
  <p>“Now, Natalie” Her voice was soft and gentle as she gave her instructions. “I want you to turn around, and get on all fours.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat turned and got back on the bed. On her knees, she walked herself towards the headboard and pillows. She bent forward and rested on her hands in front of her. She kept her eyes down.</p>
  
  <p>She felt Lottie’s weight when she got on the bed, and her presence as she approached. “Mmmm. So pretty.”</p>
  
  <p>Then Lottie’s hand was on her lower back, pressing down. “Posture, Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie nodded and held the arch in her back.</p>
  
  <p>Next she felt Lottie move to be behind her. She felt her eyes boring into her, felt that her own pussy was drenched, and felt herself throb at the sensation of being on display.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie grabbed her knees one at a time and moved them outward, so that Nat’s legs were spread apart. “Much better.” Natalie worked to keep her breathing even. “Now, Natalie, I want you to lean down, and rest your forehead on the bed.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat walked her hands back and melted down into the duvet, allowing her face and chest to rest laying flat with her arms at her sides.</p>
  
  <p>“Perfect. You look so perfect right now, baby.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie throbbed and stifled a whine. Lottie saw her shift in place, as the need building in her began to show itself.</p>
  
  <p>“Be patient, honey, you’re being so good for me.” Natalie nodded into the sheets. “This is called the puppy pose. Do you like it?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie moaned. The position heightened the obedience she felt in herself. She felt the alignment of her body and mind as completely controlled by the taller girl and the profound vulnerability of being on display. The position made Nat totally and completely <em> hers. </em></p>
  
  <p>“What did I tell you? Yes or No.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. I like it”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie felt Lottie’s weight leave the bed. “We’ll call this first position. Do you understand?” When I tell you to take first position, I want you like this.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>“Good girl.” Natalie hummed. “Now, stay.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie busied herself as she left Natalie on the bed, waiting. She put away their  school work and neatened the desk. She went back into the bathroom and freshened herself further. She sat at her vanity and combed her hair.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie listened and stayed motionless. Not entranced, but totally obedient to Lottie’s command. She didn’t think anything, she only let the feeling of being objectified and humiliated simmer in her and intensify with each moment that passed. She didn’t know how long she waited, it didn’t matter. </p>
  
  <p>Then she felt Lottie’s hand on her head, stroking her hair. “Good job, baby, you’re doing so well.” </p>
  
  <p>“Thank you, Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“You’re welcome, Natalie. Are you ready for your reward?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat felt her hips shift back as her body reacted, looking for contact. “Yes, please.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie moved to be kneeling beside her on the bed. She traced her fingers from between Nat’s shoulders along her spine, over her ass and finally to where she needed her most.”</p>
  
  <p>“So wet for me. You really like being obedient, don’t you? It makes you so needy. You like listening to me.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. It feels good.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s good, baby.” Lottie began to dip into her deliciously. Confident and slow, she traced her fingertips along her entrance. Natalie’s hips shifted again, seeking the promise of penetration.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie removed her hand. “Uh-uh. You don’t get to do anything I don’t tell you to do.” </p>
  
  <p>“I’m sorry Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s ok baby. You need to trust me, it’s for your own good. It will feel so much better if you do what I say.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes, Lottie. Thank you.”</p>
  
  <p>“Good girl.” Natalie shivered with hot anticipation. “Now touch yourself.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie gasped at the direction but complied instantly. She took her hand to her mouth then reached down, finding her clit with an urgent ease. She began to make gentle circles, applying delicious pressure. She felt her exposed pussy gush with wet need.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie moaned at the sight. Her hand returned to Nat’s drenched folds and began teasing her again. “That’s right baby, get yourself ready for me.” She ran her fingers through Natalie, lubricating them. Nat felt as the fingers teased along her entrance, then continued straight up, bringing moisture to her tight asshole. A deep moan erupted from the small blond at the feeling of being touched there, at the surprise of the overwhelming pleasure of it.</p>
  
  <p>“You like that, hm?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“Mmm. That’s not very good of you, Natalie. I don’t know if good girls like to have their assholes teased.”</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Fuck </em>.” The dirty talk was overwhelming her ability to react appropriately as she continued to tease herself. “I’m sorry Lottie, I’ll be good.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s right, sweetheart.” Then she was pressing into Natalie, two fingers instantly drenched by the heat of Nat’s pussy, her body slick and desperate as Lottie eased in and out of her entrance with slow, deliberate rhythm.</p>
  
  <p>The sensation was delirious, intoxicating. Nat was melting completely, her body trembling as her hips began to grind with determination, trying to pull those fingers deeper. She needed them inside her—needed the burning, urgent shiver crawling up her spine, the sensation of Lottie’s long fingers sinking into her, filling her completely. The walls of her pussy clenched and contracted, pulling at them, sucking them in greedily, demanding everything Lottie was giving to her.</p>
  
  <p>Nat’s fingers worked persistently against her own clit, her body trembling as she chased her own release. Her eyes were half-lidded with pleasure, face buried in the duvet, completely lost in the moment.</p>
  
  <p>“Don’t be too eager, baby. You want this feeling to last, don’t you?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie let out a sob. Her head was spinning. She attempted words but only moans made it past her throat. She felt Lottie’s skilled fingers in her, curling, finding her sweet spot with precise, maddening accuracy. “<em> Lottie! </em> ” she moaned, her voice raw and desperate as Lottie’s fingers pumped inside her, hard and fast, again and again, each stroke driving her closer to the edge. <em> “Oh my god Lottie.” </em></p>
  
  <p>Then Nat felt a hand on her hip and stilled herself at the implicit direction from Lottie’s grip. “That’s right baby, hold still.”</p>
  
  <p>She felt a gentle breath on her cheeks first, then the hot, wet warmth of Lottie’s tongue pressed against her tight hole. She felt herself clench again at the contact.</p>
  
  <p>“You need to relax, Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat nodded and tried to will herself into a deeper place of relaxation. She continued her own work on her clit and tried to drop herself deeper into the pleasure radiating from there. “That’s right. It feels good to listen. Relax for me.”</p>
  
  <p>Then Lottie’s tongue was at her ass again. It pressed forward and into her and Nat screamed at the sensation of Lottie’s mouth on her there. Nat gasped, breath coming in ragged bursts. The pressure in her body was overwhelming as Lottie began to thrust into her with her fingers again, incredibly keeping time with her tongues ministrations. </p>
  
  <p>Nat’s thighs were trembling, and her hips stuttered against Lottie’s face, her body writhing as the brunette’s mouth continued to work her asshole. Every nerve in her body was on fire, her mind slipping into a haze as Lottie brought her closer and closer. She started babbling as her climax built rapidly.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh my god <em> Lottie </em> . <em> I’m so fucking close. Thank you Lottie thank you oh my god.” </em></p>
  
  <p>Lottie hummed in encouragement, tongue and fingers deep inside Natalie, filling her completely.</p>
  
  <p><em> “Fuck Lottie” </em> Natalie felt her soul leave her body as the orgasm ripped through her. She felt herself clench and gush wet on Lottie’s hand. It seemed to last forever as wave after wave rolled through her, Lottie unrelenting as she continued to stimulate her through it.</p>
  
  <p>She felt herself go limp and fall into the mattress. She heard Lottie speak, and she swore that she had died and was hearing the voice of an angel.</p>
  
  <p>“How do you feel Natalie?”</p>
  
  <p>She had no words. If she could search for them, she’d find nothing, but as it were she couldn’t even muster an attempt. She moaned into the mattress.</p>
  
  <p>She felt Lottie’s weight leave the bed and when she returned she heard the angel’s voice again. “I’m going to clean you up a little bit now.”</p>
  
  <p>She flinched when she felt the first contact of the warm cloth on her sensitive areas, but then she felt Lottie cleaning her tenderly and it made her impossibly more relaxed.</p>
  
  <p>“There you go honey, all better.”</p>
  
  <p>Soon Lottie was in the bed with her, pulling the duvet from under her limp body and tucking her into place. She felt Lottie position her so that she was small-spooned, with her head resting on a pillow. She felt Lottie pull her close and whisper into her ear. “Good night Natalie”</p>
  
  <p>She took a deep breath and exhaled deeply as she settled into impossible comfort. “Good night Lottie.”</p>
