<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie’s alarm rang at 5:30 and Nat was jolted into wakefulness. &lt;em&gt; Fuck! &lt;/em&gt;“Lottie! Turn that shit off.” Nat tried to shake her loose to coax her out of sleep. “What time is it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; mmmph” &lt;/em&gt; Lottie looked unaffected by the noise as she rolled over to hit the alarm clock. “ &lt;em&gt; 5:30” &lt;/em&gt; she sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck? I think my ears are bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Shut up.” &lt;/em&gt; Lottie stretched in place. &lt;em&gt; “ &lt;/em&gt;Either we get up now or it’s going to go off again.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat took a pillow and wrapped it around her head with emphasis. Lottie ignored her and let herself drift off again. The next time the bell rang, Nat heard it muffled through the pillow, but still audible. She hadn’t fallen back asleep. “Lottie! Turn it &lt;em&gt; off &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Once more Lottie rolled over and hit the alarm. “It’s going to go off again.” She said it like a threat. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat groaned. “Why are you doing this to me?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie got up out of bed. She opened her blinds to let light into the room and crossed the room to turn on the overhead lights. In seconds the room was fully illuminated. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She returned to the bed to straddle the small girl. “Get up Nat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie grabbed the pillow the Nat was clutching and started to wrestle it from her grasp. Natalie only half fought her, aroused by the position the tall girl had taken over her body. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; “Give it to me!” &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; “No.” &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie overpowered her and threw the pillow out of reach. She grabbed Nat’s wrists and pinned them above her head. She glared down at her “Time to get up.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was on fire. &lt;em&gt; Make me. &lt;/em&gt; But the thought never made it out of her mouth. Looking up at Lottie, she felt herself slowly sinking into her. “Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie released and dismounted, and went into the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was breathing heavily, her gaze flicking around her as she tried to get her bearings. Alarm clock. Pillow. Windows. &lt;em&gt; Lottie’s room. &lt;/em&gt; She saw the desk and thought of the night before and sighed to herself, calming down. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she saw her unit circle pinned to the board, she smiled and felt a swell of pride. Then she got up and went over to check her backpack that sat on the chair. It had been packed with her assignments and notebook. She also found the tools she had used for the unit circle and her smile grew wider.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie came out of the bathroom and saw Nat investigating. “All packed?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Thanks Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome, Natalie.” Lottie looked over at the clock. “It’s almost 6. You should go home and get ready.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie wanted to run home but then she looked down at her backpack. “If I run home, will you bring my backpack to school for me? I’ll come get it from you in the parking lot before school.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you.” Natalie moved to grab her soccer clothes and went into the bathroom to change. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie reentered the room to find Lottie sitting down at her vanity, already nearly dressed. She looked fresh-faced, calm, and completely in order. “Wow Lot, we don’t even have to be on campus for another 2 hours.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Mmhm” Lottie hummed in response, focused on her work on her own reflection. “I’ll see you then.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She wanted to stay with Lottie. &lt;em&gt; Please ask me if I want to stay. &lt;/em&gt;“Ok uh… I’m gonna go now.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“See you later.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Bye.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat led herself downstairs and started running before she even got to the front door. The running refreshed her, and by time she got home she felt clear-headed. She got ready with a smooth rhythm, narrowly focusing on each task before her until she was stepping out and starting for school.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;As she walked she envisioned her day, mentally preparing in a way that was new to her. She thought of going to English and handing in her vocab list. She thought of Lottie and Mr. O’Neill reviewing it to find that it was complete and correct, and felt proud. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then her mind wandered to the steps of making her circles. They played over in her head. She wanted to do it again, and she thought affectionately of the tools waiting to be used again in her bag.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Her bag. &lt;/em&gt;She realized she was only minutes from seeing Lottie again and her heart began to race in her chest. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She pictured her packing her bag for her last night, packing her &lt;em&gt; school supplies &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tools &lt;/em&gt; with care. &lt;em&gt; Care. &lt;/em&gt; Lottie cared for her, took care of her. The feeling took her to a new place, and then she started to think of earlier that morning and how quickly Lottie had turned her on. &lt;em&gt; Lottie’s so &lt;/em&gt; … &lt;em&gt; in control. &lt;/em&gt; The thought released a wave of pleasure over her. &lt;em&gt; Fuck. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She took a deep breath and tried to compose herself as she approached the school. She saw the parking lot was still relatively empty so she knew it was still early. She looked for Lottie’s car but didn’t find it, so she continued into the courtyard. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat went through the front the entrance, walking past Mr. Colburn. “Good morning, Miss Scatorccio.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She kept walking. “Miss Scatorccio, I need to talk to you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stopped and turned to him ‘What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It seems you didn’t serve out your detention Friday.” He pulled out his pad. “Now, I’m happy to see you coming to class and I hope you’ve returned to practice, too. With that in mind I’ve put you down for lunch detention for the rest of the week. Serve it out and I’ll call it even. If you don’t, I’ll have to escalate to one week of ISS.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat took the slip from him without a word. &lt;em&gt; Mother fucker. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked around at the few students that were there and didn’t see anyone she knew. She suddenly felt directionless, standing in the middle of the courtyard with no tangible idea of what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Out of habit, she decided to go looking for Kevyn. She went to the back of the school to the spot and found no one there. &lt;em&gt; Of course, too early &lt;/em&gt;. She decided to stay and smoke. Half way through her second cigarette, she saw him approaching from the street behind the school. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He smiled when he saw her. “Hey Nattie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Kev, what’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Same shit. What are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;There was silence until Kevyn broke it, “What are you doing later?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Uh, ok… well uh, you wanna hang out?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck is up with you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Fuck you. I know I tried to kiss you and everything but you don’t gotta be such a bitch.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked at him like he was speaking another language. “What the fuck are you talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know dude, seems like you’re pissed.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt apathetic and already exhausted with the conversation. “I’m not pissed man, I just don’t want to hang out later. Fucking chill out.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Because I don’t”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why didn’t you come over yesterday? You said you would come after practice.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Right. &lt;/em&gt;Nat had forgotten. “Oh, uh… sorry I forgot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay dude. It’s just then I went to see if you were home, your mom said some shit about how you were with some girl… I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” She could tell he was trying to get more out of her but she didn’t feel like explaining anything to him. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He looked at her, frustrated and confused. “Whatever dude.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They smoked and stood in silence for a few more minutes until the bell rang. &lt;em&gt; Oh, Fuck. &lt;/em&gt; Natalie hadn’t realized how much time had passed and cursed not going back and looking for Lottie. Nat thought about what to do. She didn’t have enough time to go back to the parking lot or to try to find her. &lt;em&gt; She’s probably already in the room anyway. &lt;/em&gt; Nat decided to head to class.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she got there she found her bag in a seat at the front of the class. She went and took the seat, understanding the implicit direction from Lottie. She looked up and saw her in her place, at the head of the class, talking to Mr. O’Neill. She was nodding and repeating directions back to him. She eyed Natalie staring at her and smiled as she spoke. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she was done she went over to Natalie and squatted in front of her desk so that they were eye level. “Hello again”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot. Thanks for the bag.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course Natalie.” Lottie was staring into her. “Where were you this morning?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I, uh…” &lt;em&gt; Why are you so perfect? &lt;/em&gt; “Uh… I was smoking with Kev and uh… time…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie laughed and buried her face in her arm on the desk. Apparently enjoying her effect on Natalie. She looked back at her. “Well you were supposed to come meet me in the parking lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I know, I’m sorry.” It was Nat’s turn to look away. She felt her head swimming and needed relief.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s ok. I was just looking forward to walking into school with you.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked back at her. “&lt;em&gt; Really? &lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie smiled at her. “Don’t forget to hand in your vocab words.” And with that, she stood up and walked back to her desk.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded and reached around to her bag. She took the assignment out of her done folder and rose to deposit it into the homework bin.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Very good Natalie!” It was Mr. O’Neill. “Aren’t you a &lt;em&gt; diligent &lt;/em&gt; student,” he emphasized one of the words.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He took the paper from the bin. “I’ll give this to the student aide to grade and I’ll have to back for you at the end of the period. That way you can use it to start studying for your quiz as soon as possible. You’re doing great!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie smiled and looked back at Lottie. The bell rang and class began.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the front of the class was a new experience for Nat. She could hear Mr. O’Neill clearly, she could see everything he wrote on the board. She felt the rest of the class fall away behind her, as if she and Mr. O’Neill were alone in the room. She felt his attention more acutely. As if she were on stage, she felt compelled to take out her notebook and follow along, so that he would see her do it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In her focused state, class went by quickly, and she found herself surprised when Mr. O’Neill announced the bell would be ringing soon. As the class broke into a steady chatter, he returned her vocab list, which was now marked with a check mark in the corner. She looked it over and found some definitions underlined, and some crossed out. She put it into her &lt;em&gt; Doing &lt;/em&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When the bell rang Lottie rose and approached her desk. “Hey Lot, what’s your next class?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“AP Lit” Lottie put her bag on the desk. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Want to walk with me? I have to go to building 1.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Actually it’s in this room. And you’re at my desk.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh…” Natalie stood and grabbed her bag from the chair. She watched as Lottie took a seat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked up to her now. “I’ll see you in fifth hour, right?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” Natalie smiled. “I’ll see you later Lot”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Bye Natalie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie walked through the halls on a high. The way the idea of Lottie saving Nat her own seat so they could share it  made Nat feel happy, also made her feel dumb and silly. &lt;em&gt; It’s our seat.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she got to Spanish she felt relieved to find Kevin cutting. She didn’t want to explain to him what it was that had put her in such a good mood. Natalie took a seat near the front, took out her notebook, and waited for class to start.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Class went by quickly, even though it was her longest period yet. When class was over, she pulled out her detention slip and checked the room. &lt;em&gt; Gym &lt;/em&gt;. She went.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;At the gym she found a teacher she didn’t recognize at a desk in front of the bleachers. She handed him her slip, he marked it, handed it back to her, and directed, “Take a seat. Don’t sit next to anyone. No talking. No homework”. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She went to the top of the bleachers and leaned against the wall and zoned out. Sitting there in silence, she found, wasn’t &lt;em&gt; the worst &lt;/em&gt; punishment. She found herself thinking outside of the fact that someone was &lt;em&gt; making her &lt;/em&gt; be there, and she decided it was actually not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The time did drag on, though. Without anything to focus on her mind drifted to Lottie. She pictured her at lunch socializing, or smoking with her friends. She anticipated seeing her in health class and hoped she’d get to sit with her. She looked at the clock. &lt;em&gt; 25 minutes until I’m sitting with her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; 24. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; 23. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; 22. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She focused on counting down the minutes. The bell rang one minute sooner than her countdown so she noted to herself the clock was slow and was the first out the door.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She got to class sooner than anyone else and arrived to find Coach Scott alone in the room. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, Hi Natalie. How was lunch?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I had detention. I guess I beat everyone in the cafeteria.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, that’s right. Well thanks for going. It wasn’t easy convincing Colburn to go easy on you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Huh?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah he came to me and asked if you had been at practice on Friday. I told him you were, since I saw you there yesterday. I figured you could use a cover.” He winked at her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thanks coach.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No problem. Hope to see you there later.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded and turned to take a seat. Lottie arrived with Van and Tai, presumably coming from the lunchroom together. When she saw Nat she smiled wide and took the seat next to her. She kissed her on the cheek. “Hi Natalie”.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat blushed. “Hey Lot”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van and Tai took the pair of desks next to them. Van leaned over to Tai and said loud enough for everyone to hear “Wow Lottie really got her trained, huh?” She turned her attention to Nat. “Early to class Scatorccio?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie turned to face her,  “Shut up!”, and then turned back to face Lottie. “How was lunch?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It was good.” She smiled at her. “Everyone was asking about you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What did you say?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I told them I didn’t know where you were.” Lottie skirted the intention of the question.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh uh, I had detention. I have lunch detention all week for skipping detention on Friday” She produced the slip to show to Lottie. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked at it. “Ok. Good job going.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you.” She looked down at Lottie’s hands. She thought about them on her wrists. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat then thought about their desk again and about English class. She pictured Lottie at the student aide desk during her period, reviewing her vocab assignment. “Were you the one who graded my vocab words?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well what did you –” Nat was interrupted by the bell. “– think.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We can talk about it later.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Coach Scott pulled the TV stand to the front and put on a video for the class period. In the dark, Natalie found herself looking at Lottie’s hands again, and she took one in hers. She looked up at Lottie, who smiled at her. She felt herself melting. The glow of the screen on her skin made her think of Sunday. &lt;em&gt; Can I kiss you? &lt;/em&gt; The question almost spilled out of her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When the video ended, Lottie let go of her hand and Natalie felt the emptiness. She closed her first around nothing. She looked up at Lottie. “Do you think you could take me to my place before practice again? I don’t have my stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The bell rang and students started to rise from their desks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I have your cleats in my car, but yeah no problem.” Lottie stood but Natalie stayed seated, following her with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re Welcome Natalie. Will you meet me by my car this time?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be there.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good girl. See you soon.” Natalie watched her go.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van shook her from behind. “Dude.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck is going on there?” She gestured toward Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, um. Nothing”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nothing my ass. Yesterday, you show up to practice with her &lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt; leave with her, and today in class you’re &lt;em&gt; holding hands &lt;/em&gt;? You know everyone can see you guys, right?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat hadn’t thought about the rest of the class. She shrugged and started to stand from her desk.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van and Tai followed behind her. “We didn’t even know you guys were even friends, and now you’re dating?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Listen to yourself, Scatorccio. Everyone knows but you don’t?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Whatever. I just like her.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Since when?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Since you forgot how to shut up.” Nat didn’t want to try to explain herself. She couldn’t come up with a simple explanation for Van. When she asked herself why she liked Lottie a wild mix of emotions flooded her brain and made it impossible to think. “I just like her, that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van looked at her with raised eyebrows. “Whatever dude, see you at practice.” She split off with Tai.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In seventh hour, Nat tried to sit at the front again and immediately regretted it when Mr. DeMartino started his lecture in a restrained yell. His demeanor grated on her nerves and she also found that he was more likely to call on people in the front. He called on her repeatedly and denigrated her every answer. &lt;em&gt; Never doing this again &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;By the time class ended, she was eager to find Lottie. Her nerves were strained and she craved the feeling of being with her, of melting into her. The prospect alone sent a shiver down her spine and ignited a buzzing anticipation in her. She made for Lottie’s car, half running.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Lottie got there she and Jackie found Nat sitting on the trunk of the car, waiting. “Bonjour, petit toutou.” Jackie greeted her. Nat gave her a confused smile then looked to Lottie. “Hey Lot”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hi Natalie.” She kissed her on the forehead. “Thanks for waiting for me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Totally.” Nat looked at her and smiled big. When Lottie looked back she felt the soothing effect of her gaze, as she had anticipated. She stayed like that, slowly melting into the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Jackie looked from Lottie to Nat and back, a little grossed out. “Um ok lovebirds, snap out of it.” She snapped her fingers, half sarcastically and half literally trying to get their attention.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her and then back to Nat. “I need to get something from the trunk for Jackie. Come down.” She held out her hand. Nat took it and came down &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Go wait in the car.” She went to the passenger seat without saying a word to Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie opened the trunk as if nothing were out of the ordinary. Jackie crossed her arms. “Everyone knows something’s going on with you two”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah? What is everyone saying?” Lottie smirked as she grabbed a binder for Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“They’re saying you pulled a punk and got her totally whipped.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie flashed a knowing smile at her. “Huh”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well is it true?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Is what true?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you guys, like, a &lt;em&gt; thing &lt;/em&gt; now?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Wouldn’t you like to know.” Lottie was enjoying teasing her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Lottie. You &lt;em&gt; have &lt;/em&gt; to tell me. I’m the team captain! People come to me, they expect me to know!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well…” Lottie looked at Nat in the passenger seat, unsure if she was in earshot. She spoke in a hushed voice to Jackie “I don’t kiss and tell.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Jackie huffed in exasperation. “You guys seem like you’re &lt;em&gt; way &lt;/em&gt; past kissing.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well we’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, right. No leash is that tight from &lt;em&gt; just kissing &lt;/em&gt;.” Jackie paused and gave her a chance to expand on it. “Fine. I’m still going to tell everyone you guys fucked.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Jackie!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What? Is it true?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.” Lottie was getting impatient. “Don’t tell people that. If you do I’m going to tell them you and Jeff &lt;em&gt; haven’t &lt;/em&gt; fucked.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Jackie’s face got red. “Touche, bitch. I’ll see you later.” She turned to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“See ya.” Lottie went to the front of the car, got in, and started the engine.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie was looking at her. “What was that all about?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie kept her eyes forward, focused on the road. “What did you hear?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I heard Jackie say something about being past kissing and I stopped listening.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie gave a little smile and then sighed. “People are talking and they think we’re past kissing” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat thought to herself. &lt;em&gt; Are we? &lt;/em&gt; Sure, kissing Lottie was awesome but it was only part of how she felt. She thought about Lottie &lt;em&gt; all day. &lt;/em&gt;Did that make it more? It felt like it did.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are we more than kissing?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her then turned back to the road. “They are talking about fucking. They think we’re fucking.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh.” Nat felt her cheeks get warm. Her mind went back to the morning when Lottie was on top of her. She felt the arousal come back at the memory, low in her stomach. “Do you think…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really know yet Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The rest of the ride to Natalie’s was quiet. When they got there, Lottie pulled up and they went inside. “Hi Mrs. Scatorrcio” Lottie greeted Nat’s mother this time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked at Lottie, surprised. “Oh uh, hi hon.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m Lottie” She leaned in and offered her hand while Nat watched, dumbstruck.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat’s mother looked at the stupid look on her daughter’s face then back to Lottie. She took her hand gingerly. “Nice to uh, meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Pleasure’s all mine.” Lottie gave her a polite smile then turned to head towards Nat’s room. Nat followed her without saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They changed quickly and tried to imagine they were in the locker room with everyone else, and not in the private space of Nat’s room. When they finished Lottie looked at her watch. “If we leave now we’re going to have to answer their questions for 20 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat sat down on the bed. “Maybe we should kill some time.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“And how should we do that, hm?” Lottie leaned down and brought her into a kiss. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat moaned immediately, having been hungry since early that morning. She kissed with want that had been simmering all day. She moved her face to the side and held Lottie’s head to her neck, encouraging her to focus her attention there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Remember this morning?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie was nipping and sucking at her, leaving a trail of red on Nat’s pale skin. She spoke against the dip of her collar bone, now on her knees, kneeling between Nat’s legs. “What about it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Uh…” Nat’s head was swimming as she looked for the right way to describe the moment she was thinking of. “When you were holding me down.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Mmm?” Lottie came back up and brought Nat into another kiss, hungrier. She kissed roughly, with authority. Nat tried to kiss her back with equal force, but she couldn’t help but lean back. The taller girl had leverage. Then Lottie stood, brought her hands to Nat’s shoulders and pushed her back. Not so firmly that she fell, but firm enough that Natalie understood she was being directed to lay back. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie straddled her and took a wrist into each of her hands. She placed them above Nat’s head and held them there. “Like this?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt a deep ache gather low in her belly. She struggled against her grasp and raised her hips in a weak effort to free herself. “Fuck. &lt;em&gt; Yes. &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked directly at her. “Do you like that baby? You like it when I hold you down?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat caught her gaze and felt the warmth pooling in her as looked into her impossible large eyes. “&lt;em&gt; Yes &lt;/em&gt;. Fuck Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie turned up the intensity. Her stare became intentional. “Look deeper Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie instantly sunk into her, her body relaxed and she stopped struggling, her will melted away.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie held her gaze and didn’t offer any direction for some moments. She sat over her, holding, focusing, forcing her deeper and deeper down. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“How do you feel Natalie?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie only stared into her. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Answer me Natalie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Answer You”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It feels good, doesn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“Feels good.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You have been so good for me..”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I have been good.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You deserve a reward.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I deserve a reward.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to come for me, Natalie?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie couldn’t answer.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Tell me you want to come.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I want to come.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Tell me, I’m a good girl and I want to come”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I’m a good girl and I want to come”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good girl. It’s building in you now. Each word brings you closer.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“Each word brings me closer.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re so good for me. So obedient”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“So obedient.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re close now.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I’m close now.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to release you, and you’re going to come for me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“Come for you.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie broke her gaze and bent to suck on Nat’s neck. Nat came to and her orgasm crushed over her. “Oh &lt;em&gt; Fuuuccckkk &lt;/em&gt; ” She choked. Waves of pleasure rolled through her as her consciousness hung loose, released but still far gone. She rode it out, her mind fully returning to her as the final shockwaves passed. &lt;em&gt; Holy fuck &lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie kissed her softly then released her wrists and sat up. “How do you feel?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What… what the fuck was &lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie chuckled at her. “I think you know what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I mean, but… where was I?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You were with me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The answer only confused her more.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but… I wasn’t &lt;em&gt; here &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her directly. Nat groaned as she felt the pull again, her mind exhausted from the intensity of the trance that had just broken.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to practice now.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“We’re going to practice now.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie got off the bed. “Come on Natalie, it’s time to go.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.” Nat got off the bed and followed her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;As they walked out Lottie waved to Nat’s mother “Bye Mrs. Scatorccio.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Bye Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie followed Lottie out without looking at her mom.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
