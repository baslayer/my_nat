Lottie sat at her desk writing in her ritual notebook. She had transcribed the group’s responses to the final round of questions and was drawing a looping bracket between Van’s, Tai's, and Natalie’s responses. Her mind traced patterns between them: repetition, openness, shared memory. She murmured under her breath as she wrote.

“...not aligned, but related... It focused on them?”

The floor creaked in the hallway. She didn’t look up. Natalie’s voice followed a gentle knock on the door frame. “Hey Lot... It’s Sunday.”

Lottie circled a phrase and drew a line to the margin. “I know.”

“Don’t you want to have brunch?”

Lottie kept writing. “We just ate last night.”

Natalie moved to enter the space, slowly approaching the desk. "Yeah... I know. But, um... now it's time to eat again."

"I'm not hungry."

"How come?" Lottie heard the caution in her tone.

She turned to look at her. "I'm trying to figure this out Natalie. The wilderness... the symbol... there's something going on. I need to stay hungry to connect to It."

“You didn’t need to stay hungry before,” Natalie said. “Last Sunday, we ate and you still talked about It the whole time.”

Lottie closed her eyes. “That was different.”

“Why?”

Lottie shook her head. “It’s still close. I don’t want to lose it. The clarity. The quiet. Hunger keeps the door open.”

“That's crazy Lot. We have to eat.” Natalie's voice cracked. "I thought you liked feeding me."

Lottie gave her a long, stern look. "I'm not crazy."

Natalie swallowed. “I'm Sorry, I didn't mean. like. literally. I mean..." She knelt and put her hands on Lottie's lap. "It just don't make sense. And it's *Sunday*. It our day... can’t we at least have some fruit or something? Sit down for twenty minutes. Together.” She was pleading.

Lottie stared at her and put her hand on hers. She felt her heart fill with the warmth of Natalie's devotion. She looked back to the desk and found her notes now looked smudged, irrelevant. The bracket she’d drawn between responses felt suddenly childish. A breath caught in her chest.

She didn’t look back at Natalie when she spoke. “Ok, baby. Fruit.”

Natalie let out a heavy sigh. “Thank you, Lottie.”


They sat across from each other with a bowl of blueberries and sliced apples between them, alongside plain yogurt and the last of the honey from the glass jar by the stove. The windows were open just enough to let in the autumn air. 

Natalie folded her hands briefly. “Thank you,” she said, voice low. “For the food, and the time to share it. For the tradition that helps us keep track of the days. And for the fruit.” She gave a small smile and reached for the spoon.

Lottie nodded. She scooped a few blueberries into her bowl but didn’t eat right away. Her fingers tapped against the rim of the ceramic dish. Her appetite didn’t match the rhythm of the meal, but she took a bite anyway. More to honor Natalie's words than to sate her hunger.

“I’ve been thinking about what you said last night.”

Natalie looked up from her bowl.

“The plane crash. The way you talked about it... ” Lottie pushed a blueberry with the back of her spoon. “How much of it do you actually remember?”

Natalie was quiet for a moment. Then, slowly, “Some. Not all.” Her brow knit. “I remember the cabin... and then the fire." She touched her chest lightly, absently, and clutched her palm around nothing near her breast bone. "And a gun... I can almost feel the strap. The weight of it on my back.” Her eyes met Lottie's. "Like it belonged to me."

Lottie stilled.

Natalie took a breath. “You were there. But not like this. You weren’t..." She glanced at Lottie again. "...normal. We weren’t connected like we are now. You were... far away.” Natalie chewed and nodded, recollecting more as she pressed herself. “Travis was there... Coach Martinez's son.” Her voice softened. “And his little brother. Javi.” A pause. “And Ben.”

The unfamilair name gave Lottie pause. “Ben?”

Natalie blinked. “Coach Scott,” she corrected, quietly. “I don’t know why I called him that.”

Lottie felt something shift in her chest. She looked down at her bowl. She picked up a blueberry, held it between her fingers for too long, then finally placed it on her tongue. It tasted like nothing. When she swallowed, her voice came out hoarse. “We should try to go back. You and me. Try to find the thread again.”

Natalie reached for the honey jar. “Ok.”

Lottie didn’t smile. But the tension in her shoulders eased a fraction. She had eaten. They were still together. And It hadn’t left.



The theater was nearly empty. Natalie followed Lottie down the aisle without speaking, settling beside her in the middle of the row. The previews started and Natalie reached for her hand. Lottie let her fingers be laced. Natalie’s touch was gentle, familiar. The previews started. 

Lottie blinked slowly at the screen. She wasn’t watching. Her mind stayed held by the morning as her thoughts turned over and over. She heard the softness in Natalie’s voice and felt the way her warm, pleading hands had rested in her own lap. 

*It’s our day* 
*That’s crazy, Lot.*

Lottie stared straight ahead. The word hadn’t left her. It echoed now, dull and persistent.

Crazy.

She had corrected Natalie gently. She hadn’t snapped. But the word had lodged deep.

She had been called that before but never by Natalie. But still... Natalie had knelt and pleaded with her.

Lottie adjusted her fingers slightly around Natalie’s. She could feel her growing callouses from drawing tools, the faint tremble of warmth and presence. She was still here.

*You weren’t normal.*
*You were far away.*

She remembered Natalie’s fingers clutching the air at her chest, like she was feeling for a strap. A weapon. Her own weapon. She remembered the way she’d said Ben like it was natural. Like that name had always belonged to Coach Scott.

None of it made sense but she couldn't deny that she *felt* like it should.

Lottie’s eyes looked toward the screen. The movie had started. Something about a train, or a chase. She couldn’t hold onto it. Natalie leaned into her shoulder. Lottie stayed still, letting her rest there. *What if Natalie was right?* She glanced down at her.

Was that why It had shown her the dream? Was It pointing her toward Natalie again? Was It reminding her of something? Or warning her?

Her thoughts turned, slowly, toward the night ahead. They’d try again. She and Natalie. No metronome, no guests. Just the two of them. A candle maybe. Smoke. Darkness. Intention.

*What if she’s remembering another life? What if that life is bleeding into this one? What does It want from us?*

Natalie shifted slightly, thumb stroking over her hand. Lottie didn’t move but in her head the hum was loud.

They would find out tonight. She would guide Natalie. They would ask.


Lottie sat at her desk, notebook open, flipping back and forth between last night’s notes and this morning’s annotations. Nothing was fitting the way it had earlier. The bracket she'd drawn between Van, Tai, and Natalie felt arbitrary now. Too neat for something that pulsed beneath language.

From the other room, she heard the soft scrape of pencil. Natalie, drawing again. Anchored in form, while Lottie floated in symbols.

“Lot?”

Lottie didn’t answer right away. Then came the soft rustle of a chair. Natalie appeared in the doorway, sketchbook still in hand. “We should get ready. Dinner.”

Lottie didn’t look up. “Can we skip it?”

Pause. No response.

“I’ll tell him I’m not feeling well.”

Another pause. Then Natalie spoke stedily. “We skipped last week.”

“He’ll survive two.” Lottie leaned on the doorframe.

Natalie gave her a look. “He’ll notice. And he’ll make it worse next time.”

Lottie sighed and turned back toward her work. “I just  don’t want to do the whole performance thing tonight.”

“Then don’t. Just go as you.”

TShe stayed seated a while longer. The hum was quiet, but her chest still felt wired. She stood eventually and went to change.

She pulled on a black sweater with beige slacks. Neat without making a statement. When she came out, Natalie was changed, too. She wore a fitted button-down tucked into high-waisted pants, a silver chain around her neck. She was fastening the top button when she glaced at Lottie.

“How do I look?”

Lottie didn’t study her. Didn’t correct a cuff or reach to smooth her hair. Her gaze was brief, but soft. “You look good, baby. Let’s go.” She kissed her on the cheek and moved past her.



The doorman smiled wide when he saw her. “Good evening, Miss Lottie Pop,” he said, tipping his hat. "Looking beautiful as always."

Lottie gave a polite smile. “Hello, Gregory.”

Natalie murmured a quiet “Hi” as they passed through. The elevator was already waiting.

The penthouse smelled faintly of lemon and wood polish when the doors opened. Warm light glowed through the foyer. Malcolm appeared from the dining room, barefoot in navy slacks and a cream shirt with the top button open.

“My girls,” he said warmly, and kissed each of them twice on the cheek. First Natalie, then Lottie. His cologne was faint but expensive.

Natalie smiled. “Hi, Mr. Matthews.”

“Come in, come in. Wine’s breathing. Dinner’s plated. Let’s not let it get cold.”

The table was already set in the formal dining room, three seats and white linen. Dinner was already plated: salmon, farro, something green with citrus. Malcolm had opened a red. The place settings were meticulous with cloth napkins, polished forks, and water already poured. Lottie slid into her seat without comment.

Natalie smiled politely as Malcolm poured wine. “Smells great.”

“It’s good to see you again,” he said. “I missed you last week.”

“Yes. Sorry about that. I was feeling a little overwhelmed.” Natalie replied.

Malcolm gave Lottie a pointed glance. “I see.”

She picked up her fork, ignoring him. The salmon was perfect. She took one bite, then pushed it gently through the sauce.

Conversation was light at first. Malcolm asked about Natalie’s classes. Lottie tuned it out. She sipped her wine and watched her father’s hand as he gestured, steady and composed. A pianist’s hand moving with precise and clean form.

“How’s the thesis coming?” Malcolm asked after a few bites, turning his gaze to Lottie.

She didn’t look up from her fork. “It’s coming.”

“That’s all I get?” He took a sip of wine but held his eyes on Lottie. She felt them boring into her.

She sighed. “It’s abstract.”

Lottie's mind distanced herself from the table. The atmosphere felt curated and suffocating, as though it were specifically decorated to keep her mind silent. She became hyper aware of every fine detail and dwelt upon each one individually. The rug, the drapes, the light fixtures. Her gaze was restless and landed everywhere but on her father's in front of her.

Malcom turned away from her. “Natalie, is Lottie eating?”

Natalie didn’t hesitate. “Yes, she is.”

"Do you see her eat or is she just telling you that she is?"

Lottie’s jaw tensed. “I’m right here.”

He didn’t look at her. “Because sometimes she isn't honest about these things.”

Natalie looked at Lottie then back to Malcom. "Yes, we eat together almost every meal."

Malcolm glanced at Lottie, then back to Natalie. “If you say so. Just know, when she’s not, that’s usually one of the first signs. It doesn’t start with delusions, the beginning is usually more subtle. Meals help maintain rhythm. You might think about setting a schedule.”

“Don't.”

Malcolm ignored her. “It’s important to catch it early. Before the thread frays too far.”

“I don’t need a babysitter.” Lottie's tone sharpened.

“Well.” Malcolm laid down his fork and looked at her directly again. “You might need one.”

Lottie worked hard to keep her breathing even but she could hear her heart hammering in her ears. She held Malcom's gaze with gritted teeth, and felt Natalie's eyes on her, too. The edges of her vision blurred. She tried to blink but couldn't.

“I can tell you're off.” Malcolm continued, smoothing his napkin, “When the structure slips, you start to float. And floating is where it gets dangerous.”

Lottie pushed the words out. "Just because I'm not in the mood to perform for you doesn't mean I'm..." She glanced at Natalie. "...not right. I’m still taking my medication."

“That doesn’t mean they’re enough.”

Natalie took Lottie's hand and squeezed. She spoke directly to Lottie first. "He's just concerned, ok?" She turned to Malcom. "Thank you for the advice Mr. Matthews. I think..." she looked to Lottie and back. "I think she's just working really hard on her thesis. Lots of late nights writing. If anything just a little short on sleep."

Malcolm’s gaze lingered, then he gave a slow nod. “I hope you're right, Natalie. Either way, she needs structure. Sleep is half the battle and waking at the same time every day is just as important.”

Lottie freed her hand from Natalie's and took the napkin from her lap. She folded it and placed it on the table with careful grace. "I think that's enough. May we please be excused?"

He gave a tight smile. “Of course.” He rose as she stood, Natalie rising from her seat last. "Thank you for coming. Even if you do feel it necessary to leave before dessert."

Natalie turned, thanked him, and wished him a good evening.

"You, too Natalie. Goodnight Charlotte."

Lottie didn’t flinch. She stepped into the elevator without answering him.


They walked home in silence.

The city pulsed around them, headlights and footsteps and weekend noise, but Lottie barely registered it. Natalie’s hand gripped hers tightly the whole way back, and she gripped it back.

Inside the brownstone, the door shut behind them with a soft click. Lottie started toward the office, already seeing her notebook open on the desk, already feeling the need to unload the buzzing from her mind onto the page.

But Natalie didn’t follow. Instead, she called after her. “Can we talk?” Her voice had no edge to it. Just need.

Lottie didn’t turn around. “We already talked. Or, you know, my father did.”

“Please.”

Lottie exhaled. "Fine."

They moved to the couch. Lottie didn’t sit back, just leaned forward against fingers knit together with her elbows on her knees. Natalie eased beside her, leaving just enough space that Lottie didn’t feel crowded.

“I don’t think he meant to jump on you,” Natalie started. “I just think he’s just... worried.”

“You don’t know him like I do.”

Natalie stayed quiet and kept her eyes on Lottie as she stared at the coffee table. 

“He gets off on seeing me slip. He likes it." She turned to look at Natalie directly. "Because when I do, he gets to control everything again." She began enumerting with her fingers. "The schedule. The staff. It's all fucking part of it.” She shook her head. “He calls it care, but it’s power.”

There was a beat of quiet then Natalie said softly, “Yeah. I believe you. His tone wasn’t very nice.”

Lottie looked at her. Her expression didn’t soften, but something inside her did.

“Thank you,” she said. The words came out more vulnerable than she meant.

Natalie nodded. Then: “But… he did have a point. About the eating.”

Lottie sat upright. “I just ate this morning. And we ate last night.”

“Lottie. You know what I'm talking about.”

“You think I’m not taking care of myself?”

“I didn’t say that.”

Lottie stood up and took two steps toward the kitchen, pacing, then turned back. “He doesn’t understand like you do.”

Natalie hesitated. Her voice barely a whisper. “Sometimes... I don’t really understand either, Lot.”

That landed. Lottie’s jaw clenched. She crossed her arms tightly, as if to hold herself together. “That’s the problem. There’s so much we don’t understand. And we have to figure it out. All of it.”

“I know. But... do we have to?” Natalie looked up at her. Her voice was small, honest. “I just want to... I don’t know. Go back to normal. Whatever that means.”

Lottie stared at her like she’d said something sacrilegious. “How can you not be thinking about this?” Her voice shook. “Last night. The dream. What you said at the table. The memories. The symbol. We were somewhere else. Together. And It was there. You said you felt It. How can you just want to ignore that?”

“I’m not ignoring it... just. It's not important to me. Not like you are.”

“We have to figure this out, Nat.” Her hands trembled. “We can’t have normal unless we understand why It is here. It wants to take you away from me.”

Natalie didn’t answer right away but Lottie could see her chest rising and falling rapidly. She just stood up slowly and crossed the distance between them. 

She touched Lottie’s forearm and she looked directly into her. “Nothing’s going to take me from you, Lot. Definitely not It.”

Lottie blinked. *She doesn’t know what It can do.*

Natalie pulled at her arm and moved it from her so that it was by her side, then she leaned into her chest and buring herself there. Lottie put her arms around her but still felt miles away. Her breathing continued heavily, and she could see Natalie rising and falling with it against her.

"Lottie... maybe, we can at least, y'know, make a schedule? That always makes me feel better."

She stroked her head. "I don't know."

“Please? We can make it together.”

Lottie leaned back and searched her face. She could see the worry in her eyes. Lottie swallowed. “Only if you promise me something.”

Natalie nodded. “Anything.”

“We'll include time to figure this out. All of it. I'm not going to feel better until I do. I need to know why It chose us.”

Natalie didn’t flinch. “Ok, Lot.”

Lottie took a long breath, trying to steady the surge in her chest. “Ok baby, let’s make the schedule.”


Natalie fetched her pencil bag and sat cross-legged at the table. She tore a clean sheet from the sketchpad. Her hand moved with practiced calm, drawing clean verticals for the days of the week, measured blocks for windows of hours. 

Lottie sat beside her at the table and watched. Natalie’s calm radiated from her, soft and steady, and Lottie could feel it settling into her own chest. Her grip was sure, her lines deliberate. She didn’t sketch like a beginner anymore. There was control in her hand now... an ease, even elegance. Lottie smiled, a quiet swell of pride rising in her. She learned so fast.

She felt the hum quieting in her chest as she watched Natalie rule the days. She noticed how she used Lottie’s preferred color scheme. No label went unframed. No line was careless. Each stroke was a small act of care.

It wasn’t just organization. It was devotion, again, clear and obvious and on display.

Lottie looked at her and felt a slow, warm ache open in her sternum. She wasn’t being managed. She was being tended to. Natalie didn’t need her to perform wellness. She didn’t need her to be stable so she could brag or feel secure. She just... needed her. As she was. Fully. Entirely.

She’s not like him, Lottie thought. She doesn’t need me to be an emblem of his success, his restraint, his genius. She doesn’t need me as proof of anything.

She needs me because she loves me.

If Lottie slipped, Natalie wouldn’t get to lecture her, wouldn’t reassert dominance. She would just lose her. And Lottie could feel, viscerally, that Natalie couldn’t bear that. It softened something inside her that had been tight since dinner.

Natalie finished the last line and looked up, tentative. “What do you think?”

Lottie met her gaze. “It’s perfect.” She kissed her cheek. “You’re perfect. Thank you.”

Natalie gave a tired little smile. “Sure, Lot. I just want you to feel better.”

“I do." She sighed, content for the first time all day. "You're so good for me.”

After they finished, Natalie tapped the pencil softly against the paper and smiled. “According to the schedule, it’s piano time for thirty minutes, then meditation.” She looked over. “Sound good?”

Lottie nodded, still softened from the feeling of Natalie’s care. “Yeah. I like that.”

Natalie fixed the schedule to the fridge, next to hers, then followed Lottie to the piano. Lottie played slow arpeggios, gentle minor chords. Natalie sat beside her, not speaking, just listening, her thigh warm against Lottie’s. The hum was low again, barely present. When the half hour passed, Lottie closed the lid gently and stood.

She turned to Natalie, voice steady. “Ok. Now meditation, right?”

"Yes Lottie."

The office lights were dimmed. Lottie went to the desk and took her ritual notebook and then took her place across from Natalie. She waited for her to settle into the floor cushion, then lit the candle between them. When their eyes met, Lottie felt her own mind quiet.

“We’ll begin the way we used to,” she said calmly. “With the metronome. One minute. Hold my gaze.”

Natalie nodded and reached to start it. The gentle tick tick began, and they locked eyes. Lottie slowed her breathing and watched Natalie’s pupils shift as she entered rhythm. She was still, obedient. Ready.

After the minute, Lottie reached forward and stilled the metronome. The silence that followed was dense.

“Close your eyes.” Natalie obeyed.

Lottie closed her eyes and let her voice drop. “Picture the wilderness. Let it form around you.”

She felt herself sink into it as she spoke, letting the memory take hold. In her mind’s eye, the trees rose high above her, their shapes shifting gently in the wind. She could hear that wind, too, threading through branches, carrying the low murmur of unseen life. Pine thickened the air, earthy and clean. She breathed it in and held it, willing the feeling to settle deep in her chest.

Lottie inhaled slowly, eyes still closed, and let the next words come in a hush. “You’re in the cabin now. Look around. What do you see? What do you smell?”

Even as she spoke, the space rose up around her too. She felt the shift, the hush of the trees giving way to something heavier. The air changed. Inside the cabin, the pine was gone, replaced by the sour tang of damp wood, the ghost of old smoke, and something metallic beneath it all. Her breath faltered slightly.

It was darker in there. Stiller. She could almost hear the creak of the boards settling beneath her feet, the way her own steps had sounded the first time she entered.

She had been afraid then. And she was afraid now.

The presence was immediate. Dense. It crowded the corners, pulsing low behind the walls, pressing against her ribs. Her chest tightened.

It wasn’t like outside, where It felt vast and unnameable. In the cabin, It was focused. Watching. As though It had been waiting for her. Lottie felt herself clench against the memory, the sensation. This wasn’t a holy place. It wasn’t sanctuary. It was a trap.

Still, she didn’t stop. She steadied her voice and continued, even as her hands curled into fists in her lap.

Lottie’s throat was tight. She didn’t open her eyes. She softened her voice, but couldn’t smooth the edge in it. “It’s not safe in here, is it?” she murmured. “You feel that too.”

She let a beat pass and let Natalie breathe in whatever the cabin was becoming for her.

Then she said, lower still, “You’re not alone. Travis is here. Ben is here. You can feel them, can’t you?”

Lottie swallowed. The image pressed harder behind her eyes. Ben reading in the corner, Travis gazing into the fire, each with something unsaid in their eyes.

“Now...” She hesitated, lips parted, not wanting to stay there. “Now you’re outside. You’ve stepped out. The trees feel... safer again.”

She tried to let that feel true, let the air shift again in her own mind. It helped, slightly. Her breath evened out. She imagined sunlight flickering through the branches.

“There’s weight on your chest,” she continued, steadier now. “It’s yours. The strap of your gun. You’re holding it close. It knows you. It belongs to you.”

Another pause. Lottie’s voice dipped again. “Listen. What do you hear? Not just the wind. Listen closer. What’s out there?”

Even as she asked it, something bristled in her gut. Lottie let the silence stretch out. Then, gently, “Ok. Open your eyes.”

Natalie’s eyes opened slowly. She blinked, breath quiet but a little uneven. Lottie took a moment to make notes about her impressions before pressing.

After a moment she turned her attention back to Natalie. “What did you see?”

Natalie didn’t answer right away. She looked down, like she was still half-there.

“The cabin felt...” she started, then frowned. “Old. Like no one had lived there in years. You could smell it.”

Lottie nodded, slowly.

“It didn’t feel good,” Natalie said. “Like, I didn’t want to be in there. Something was... wrong. Like it had soaked into the walls.”

Lottie felt a cold ripple slide down her spine. “Yes,” she whispered. “I felt that too.”

Natalie’s gaze drifted again. “Then I was outside. I heard the wind, birds, something moving under the brush. Small animals, maybe. I think I was listening for them.”

“For a hunt?” Lottie asked.

“Yeah.” Natalie nodded. “Travis was with me, I think. I didn’t see him exactly, but I could feel him. He was close. Maybe right behind me.”

Lottie swallowed the strange knot forming behind her ribs. “You were hunting together.”

"Yes." Natalie looked at her, as if Lottie had clicked something into place. “That’s what we did. We were good at it.” She hesitated. “It felt like survival. Like, we needed it. For food.”

Lottie nodded faintly, but her eyes stayed on Natalie’s.

“I saw Ben too,” Natalie said. “Not in the cabin. He was by the river. We were sitting there, talking. I think we were talking about love.”

Lottie’s brows lifted slightly. “And what did he say?”

Natalie blinked again, and she began to smile faintly. “He told me... it's everything. Love is everything.” She brought a hand to touch just below her eye. “I think I was crying.”

Lottie exhaled softly. Her voice came quiet, almost hesitant. “Do you think you were talking about me?”

Natalie didn’t answer, but her gaze lingered on Lottie’s face.

Lottie understood. She made notes about what Natalie had shared.

“When I pictured the cabin… I felt something. Heavy.” Her voice dipped. “I saw Ben. And Travis. But they looked... wrong. Distant. Like they weren’t all there.” She shook her head slightly. “Something was in that place. Watching. Pressing in.”

She paused, her hands curling slightly in her lap. “It felt evil. Not dramatic evil...maybe ancient. Rotten. Like whatever was in the cabin had been waiting there before any of us ever came. Like it already knew who we were.”

Her breath hitched as she tried to explain. “But outside... outside was different. I could feel the trees, the air moving through them. I felt part of it. I wasn’t afraid anymore.” Her eyes lifted to Natalie. “The wilderness didn’t want to hurt us. Not like the thing in the cabin. Out there, It was quiet. Present. Sacred.”

Natalie listened, brows knit. “I didn’t feel that,” she said finally. “Any of that.”

Lottie stilled.

Natalie went on, “It didn’t feel sacred. It just felt like survival. Like everything in me was focused on staying warm, finding food, protecting Travis. Listening for anything that might get us first.” She rubbed her hands together absently. “I didn’t feel anything watching me. Just... cold.”
