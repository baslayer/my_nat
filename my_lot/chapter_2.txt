The faint sound of the radio stirred Lottie from sleep. It was still dim, the pale suggestion of dawn just beginning to show behind the curtains. Beside her, Natalie reached across the nightstand and silenced it.

Lottie shifted under the blankets, her voice husky with sleep. “What time is it?”

“5:00” Natalie spoke just above a whisper.

Lottie turned her face into the pillow. “Why so early? When’s your class?”

“First one’s at 7:30.” Natalie spoke as she sat up. “I want to run first, and it takes a while to get to campus.”

Lottie reached out, brushing her fingers against Natalie’s arm. “Do you want me to make breakfast?”

“No, it’s okay. Go back to sleep.” Natalie’s weight shifted on the bed. She planted a gentle kiss on Lottie’s cheek and whispered near her ear, “Don’t worry. I’ll set the alarm for you.”

“Thank you, baby.” Lottie sighed, eyes already closing. “Have a good day.”

She woke again to the digital beeping of the alarm. The bed beside her was cold. She stretched, ran a hand over her face, and sat up slowly.

In the bathroom mirror, her face still held a faint crease from the pillow. But her skin—golden, warm—looked more rested today. She rinsed with cold water and took her meds without hesitation. The rhythm was ingrained. She stripped and stepped into the shower, letting the water hit her back as she started mentally arranging her day.

No one to cook for this morning. In the kitchen, she peeled a clementine and spooned yogurt into a bowl. Her appetite was small. Her mind was already half on her reading. Ethnographic Methods at nine. She started drafting questions in her head. Something about insider-outsider narratives, maybe, and how belief shifts when you study it too closely.

She ate standing at the counter, watching shadows shift against the tile. Her thoughts returned to her thesis. She considered the texts she still wanted—esoteric, harder to find. Cult studies had been on her list for weeks. She should finally go looking.

The idea settled quickly, decisively: I’ll go after class.

When she was done, she washed the bowl, dressed, and checked her bag. Notes. Laptop. Highlighters. Check, check, check.

She locked the door behind her and exhaled as she stepped outside.

Fordham’s anthropology wing was cool and quiet that morning, the hallway echoing faintly with footsteps and closing doors. Lottie took her usual seat in the front near the window in Ethnographic Methods and opened her notebook, flipping to a fresh page. The professor’s voice faded in and out around her focus. She was listening, but not all of her was present. As they discussed participatory observation and reflexivity, her hand moved steadily, filling the page with tidy script.

She marked concepts with her own shorthand: a spiral for cyclical experience, a triangle for the sacred, a circle around terms that felt activated, like “liminality” and “trance states.” One margin note read simply: Observer as vessel? She underlined it twice.

She found herself wondering if ethnography itself was a form of ritual. The act of descending into another’s world, adopting their cadence, then returning changed. Like pilgrimage. She jotted a final symbol: a dot within a circle—and closed her notebook when class ended.

The streets buzzed a little louder as she walked south, her thoughts crowding quietly behind her eyes. She took the Q to Union Square, then made her way toward the narrow storefront she’d seen weeks ago: Cosmos and Logos, painted in faint gold on the glass. 

The bell on the bookstore door gave a soft metallic jingle as Lottie stepped inside. It smelled of dust and sandalwood. Incense burned somewhere, faintly, threading through the stacks. The shelves rose high—no signs, no categories. Just wood and paper and quiet.

She moved without direction, her hand brushing along bindings. Her eyes ran over old titles with cracked spines and occult diagrams stamped in gold leaf. 

She turned a corner and found a low shelf labeled Mysticism & Comparative Theology. Lottie crouched and began pulling volumes into a stack at her feet. The Brotherhood of the New Life. Voices in the Wilderness: American Prophets & Utopians. The Cloistered Flame: Female Visionaries of the 19th Century. One cover was hand-stitched in linen. She traced a spiral drawn into the margin of a title page and stilled with recognition. *What is it you want to show me?*

“Finding what you need?”

Lottie looked up. A man stood a few feet away. He was barefoot in loose linen pants and wore a beaded necklace hanging low over a sunken chest. His hair was pulled back into a loose knot. His eyes were unfocused and his expression was relaxed in a way that looked familiar to Lottie. Vacant.

She spoke slowly, as though she wasn't sure he would fully understand. “Yeah... I’m looking for books on emergent belief systems. Early stages of ritual structure and syncretism." 

“Like... the truth before it hardens.”

"Sort of. I think I've got what I need...”

“It speaks in pattern."

That gave her pause... something about the way he said it set her teeth slightly on edge. "It?" 

"Right. Not language. Not even symbol, really. Just It.”

She looked at him suspiciously, then added defensively. “I’m working on a thesis. It's academic. I’m not...”

“You’re listening.” He interrupted her. “Not everyone can. It always finds a listening ear.”

Lottie narrowed her eyes skeptically. She felt as though he may be coercing her somehow.

“I'm not sure you understand." She tried to be patient. "I’d be interested in anything on historical communes or millenarian movements." She trired to speak firmly to ground the conversation in something other thanthe abstract. “Especially ones that used architecture or music to structure belief.”

He held her gaze for a moment too long, then turned. “Follow me.”

She hesitated, then did.

He led her through a crooked row of shelves, fingers grazing the bindings as he walked. “They all started as corrections,” he murmured. “Visions. Dreams. A voice. You know how it begins.”

Lottie wasn’t sure whether he was speaking to her or to himself. He pulled a few books and handed them to her as he moved through the aisle: The Inner Circle at Oneida, The Harmonies of the Cosmos, Communion Through Design: Sacred Geometry in Intentional Communities.

She took them with a nod. “Thanks.”

He didn’t move. Just looked at her and said, “If you’re asking the right questions, the right questions will start asking you back.” She gave a polite smile and turned away, but her skin prickled. She felt watched even after he’d vanished down the aisle.

She didn’t believe him but his phrasing stuck with her despite her effort to push it away. *It always finds a listening ear.*


Lottie stood for a moment in the quiet of the brownstone entryway, her arms full of books, the stale incense smell still clinging to her clothes. She set the stack down on the kitchen table and leaned against the counter.

She wanted brushed the encounter off... chalk it up to Brooklyn weirdness and moved on but the man’s phrasing clung to her. *It always finds a listening ear.*

She pushed away from the counter and took her laptop into the office. She had an assignment due for Ethnographic Methods, a short written exercise on positionality and methodological ethics. She opened a blank document and stared at the blinking cursor. She typed:
*Subjectivity is not the enemy of ethnography.*
Then deleted it.

She leaned back in the chair, rubbed at her temple. The desk felt unusually large in front of her. She tried again:
*In observing belief, the challenge is not the distance between self and subject, but the proximity. The blur.*
Better, maybe. But her thoughts circled elsewhere.

The books from the shop sat just out of reach but she felt the titles calling her like sirens. *Finish the assignment.* Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, but she couldn't generate an idea to pass to them. She wentto her notebook instead. She flipped it open, past her tidy thesis outline, and found an empty page. Then, without consciously deciding to, she drew the spiral from the book spine in the center.

Her mind jolted into activity. *Some systems arise not from doctrine, but from need. Need shapes ritual. Repetition creates structure. Structure becomes a vessel for meaning and meaning opens a channel to It.*

She shook her head in an effort stop the train of thought in its tracks. She wrote instead a short statement: It begins with repetition.

She felt her academic voice slipping from her. She tried to hold onto it but her ideas felt increasingly unmoored. Not because she wasn’t thinking clearly, but because her clearest thinking felt like it was coming from somewhere without foundation. From the same place her thesis lived. Something humming at the edge of sense, threading itself through her ideas, waiting to be followed.

She closed the notebook and took a long breath.

This wasn’t about that man. She didn’t care what he thought he saw or heard.
But he’d said a word she hadn’t spoken to him. *It.*
And that was what unsettled her.

Lottie stared at the closed notebook for a moment longer. The quiet of the brownstone pressed at her. She reached for her phone, punched Natalie’s number, and hit call.

It rang once. Twice. Three times.

No answer.

She pulled the phone from her ear and stared at the screen. She let her arm fall back to her side.

She looked at the time and tried to remember what Natalie had said about her schedule and couldn't. She only felt her absence.

She set the phone down and glanced toward the books on the kitchen table. She didn’t want to go back to them but they continued to call to her. Defiantly, she collected them and moved them into the office and returned to the kitchen. She looked at the wall clock. 3:30. An hour until her piano student should arrive. She felt her heart rate pick up and closed her eyes to count to even her breath. In. Out. In. Out. 

*What can I do?*
*You know what to do.*

She opened her eyes. *No.*

She went to the kitchen and resolved to prepare dinner ahead of time. "Process. Structure." She spoke the words aloud to keep them from adding to the noise in her head. “That’s what we’re doing.”

She pulled out vegetables one by one, placing them next to the sink in a neat row: bok choy, red bell pepper, green onion, a knob of ginger. "Clean the vegetables." She washed them.

She peeled the ginger, then began slicing each piece into uniform slivers.

“Julienne the pepper.” 
“Bias cut for the scallions.” 

Her voice steadied with each step, the tactile rhythm of preparation rooting her.

She turned to press tofu between folded towels, weighted by the cast iron skillet. “Drain the excess. No one likes soggy tofu.” It was a thing Natalie had said once. Lottie smiled as she repeated it quietly.

Her knife moved over garlic, then shallot. She worked without break to stay in motion. The more she chopped, the less the It echoed in her.

Sauce next. In a small bowl: soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, chili crisp. “Two tablespoons.” She measured instead of free pouring. “One teaspoon. Stir. Taste.” 

By the time she slid the tofu into the hot pan, the sizzle felt like punctuation. She added aromatics, stirred. A familiar scent bloomed. “Sequence, Intention.” She spoke softer and felt herself relax.

She set the finished stir fry aside to cool, covering it with a clean dish towel. She looked at the clock. *4:15.* Too early to set the table. Too early to let herself think again.

She wiped her hands on a dishtowel and crossed into the living room, opening the piano bench and drawing out a worn book of sheet music. She craved something structured over improvising. She wanted a line to follow.

She sat down and began to play. Her fingers moved carefully over the keys, eyes scanning the page in steady rhythm. The music was clean, disciplined. She sight-read with the precision of someone who had learned very young and never stopped.

Major to minor. Sustain pedal, then release. She let the notes occupy her thoughts. Kept them full. Kept them obedient. She was still playing when the doorbell rang.

The student was young with thin wrists and a habit of glancing nervously at Lottie after every wrong note. She smiled gently and gestured for her to begin again.

She felt the act of teaching ground her in the structure of intimacy and shared rhythm. Here was a task with a shape, with rules. A beginning, a middle, an end. And her role was clear: to guide, to correct, to hold the tempo steady so someone else could find it.

They worked through scales, then a short étude. She tapped the edge of the bench in time as she played. “Let the left hand follow your breathing.” The words didn't enter her mind until they were already in the air. Her student tried again, and this time the measure came easier.

She gave praise where it was due. She adjusted her wrist position, demonstrated a phrase, spoke softly when she faltered. With each exchange, the internal noise from earlier quieted. The voices she hadn’t wanted to name retreated behind the metronomic tick of discipline and care. There was no spiraling here. No It. Just the thrum of muscle memory and the way a child’s eyes lit up when she played something right.

When the lesson ended, she walked her to the door and reminded her to practice only what was marked. Her mother nodded a thanks, and then they were gone. Lottie returned to the living room and let out a long, even breath.


Lottie had just finished wiping down the kitchen counter when she heard Nat's ringtone. The tinny 8-bit music brought her relief.

“Hi baby.”

“Hey.” Natalie’s voice came warm but slightly rushed, wind in the background. “Sorry I missed your call. I just saw it.”

“That’s okay.” Lottie tucked the phone between her shoulder and ear as she leaned against the counter. “I just wanted to hear your voice.”

A small pause. “Is everything ok?”

Lottie hesitated for a beat. “Yeah, I think so."

She heard Natalie's breath as she walked. "How's your day going?"

"Class was fine. Nothing really to report. I stopped by that bookstore after, the one on Flatbush. I found a few things that might help with the thesis.”

“That’s good.” Natalie spoke with a forced lightness, encouraging her. “You just finished your lesson, right?”

Lottie smiled faintly. “Yeah. How’d you know?”

“I can tell.” Lottie could hear the grin in her voice. “Your voice has that... post-teaching calm.”

“I do feel better now.” Lottie admitted. Then, softer: “I need a copy of your schedule. I missed you today.”

“I’ll give it to you when I get home.” Natalie never broke a promise to Lottie. “I’m heading to studio now. I had drawing earlier, then lunch, then structures. It’s been kind of non-stop. These classes are like, 3 and a half hours long.”

Lottie could picture her walking with a sketchbook under her arm, her bag over one shoulder. “Dinner’s already made. I kind of did it in a fever.” She bit her lip. “When do you think you'll be home?”

Natalie exhaled then spoke uneasily. “As soon as I can. We’ve got our first critique tomorrow so I might be stuck there a while.”

Lottie didn’t answer right away. When she did, her voice was even, but carried a faint shadow. “Okay. I understand.”

Natalie repeated her question from the beginning of the call. "Is everything ok?"

"Yes Natalie. I'm ok."

“I’ll call if I’m running really late.”

“Alright,” Lottie said. “Good luck in studio, baby.”

“Thanks, Lot. Try to, you know, take it easy. I’ll see you later.”

"Bye."

Lottie slipped her phone into her pocket and went back to the office, feeling grounded and confident She exhaled as she rolled her shoulders back. The quiet of the house settled around her again, but it felt less oppressive now. Natalie’s voice still lingered in her ears.

She opened her laptop and pulled up the blank document she’d abandoned earlier. Her fingers hovered over the keys. This time, they moved with steadiness.

*In observing belief, the challenge is not the distance between self and subject, but the proximity. The blur. The permeability of the researcher’s interior life.*

She paused and read it back. It held.

*To study a system of meaning requires recognizing the invisible scaffolding within oneself. We are not immune to pattern, to ritual, to need. That doesn’t make us unreliable observers. It makes us honest ones.*

She typed cleanly for the next hour. She kept her tone scholarly and measured but didn’t try to push away the thoughts that had unsettled her earlier. She integrated them carefully. By the time she hit save, her breath was slow, even.

She pushed her chair back and stretched. A small flame of pride lit in her chest for finding her way back to completing the task.

Next, Lottie went to complete her proposal, fleshing out her outline. The document came together in fits and bursts, her fingers flying over the keyboard in intervals. She bounced between sources: citations, scans, open books, handwritten notes. 

She imagined pages cross-referenced each other like branches twining from the same trunk. Some of her margin scrawl had evolved into shorthand symbols that she no longer questioned. She didn't notice as night fell and the room grew dark.

Natalie's voice came tired from the doorway. “Hey Lot... are you ready to eat?”

Lottie blinked up from the screen. The only light in the room came from the monitor, casting an eerie glow across her face. She turned to the door, disoriented. “What time is it?”

“A little after 10. I jsut got home... I got kinda carried away in the studio.”

Lottie closed her laptop halfway, rubbing at her eyes. “Shit.”

Natalie stepped closer, eyeing the open notebook beside the laptop. “You get a lot done?”

“I think so.” Lottie said, distractedly. “It’s all sort of... pouring out.”

Lottie led them to the kitchen. She put the stir-fry in a pan to warm it as Natalie set the table. 

“So how’s the proposal?” Natalie asked after a few bites.

Lottie exhaled through her nose and nodded slowly. “Good. I think I found my angle. I'm ready for the meeting with Dr. Riis tomorrow.”

"Looked really involved." Natalie gestured towards the office. "You’ve got, like... symbols?”

“They help me map concepts." Lottie hesitated. "I don’t really know how to explain them yet.”

Natalie didn’t push. She just gave a soft “okay” and kept eating.

Lottie cleared her throat gently. “Tell me about your studio. And your critique tomorrow.”

Natalie leaned back a little. “The studio’s good. It’s a lot. People are already building things, it’s wild. The critique is at 10. I think it’s supposed to be casual? But I’m still nervous. I don’t really know if I’m doing anything right. I’m just... trying stuff. Letting it flow.”

“That’s good.” Lottie said gently. “You’re letting It work.”

Natalie gave her a look, affectionate but wry. “Yeah, well, then I’m blaming *It* if they tear my work apart.”

They finished their food in comfortable quiet. Afterward, they clearead the table together and did the dishes. 

Natalie grabbed a sheet of paper and her pencil bag, and returned to her seat at the table. Lottie sat with her, watching without comment as she began sketching out her weekly schedule in a tidy grid. She watched as Nat shaded blocks of time, labeling studio hours, classes, and breaks in Lottie’s preferred color system. She listened as Natalie started narrating softly as she filled it out. 

“Monday: Studio from nine to five, dinner with you..." She looked up and smiled. "Tuesday has drawing, structures, studio..."

Lottie didn’t interrupt. She just listened, eyes soft, breathing steady, anchoring herself in the sound of Natalie’s voice. When Natalie finished, she rose and affixed the schedule to the front of the refrigerator. “There. Does that help?”

“Yes.” Lottie stood and crossed to her. She drew Natalie into an embrace, letting her chin rest on her head. “Thank you. Much better.”

She pulled back and leaned down to find her mouth, kissing her deeply. The moment their lips met, she felt Natalie soften as the connection between them strengthened. When she broke the kiss, she didn’t move away. She let her eyes settle on Natalie’s and held her gaze the way she always had. Steady and sure, allowing herself to flow into her.

Natalie’s breath caught so slightly she though she might’ve imagined it. Her expression didn’t shift dramatically, but there was a hint, something almost imperceptible, in the muscles around her eyes. Lottie watched her face. Waited.

“Lottie?” Natalie’s voice was soft.

“Yes, Natalie?”

“You feel...” Natalie’s brow furrowed. “Crowded.”

Lottie blinked once but she didn’t speak. She only studied her as if she could trace the exact origin of the word on her face.

A beat passed then her voice came quiet. “You've never said that before.”

Natalie didn’t answer. Her gaze stayed trained on Lottie, but the question in it remained. Something uncertain at the edges.

Lottie let her hand settle lightly at the base of the smaller girl's skull. “I’m here with you. Only me.”

"Only you."

She kissed her again, then whispered in her ear. “Come to bed.”

Natalie did. 
Lottie could still feel the word lingering in her. *Crowded.*
