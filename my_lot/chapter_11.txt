Lottie felt a hand press lightly to her arm. “Lottie. Will you come run with me?”

Lottie looked up. Natalie was already in her sports bra and shorts, hair tied, eyes puffy but alert. She looked hopeful.

Lottie reached up, brushed a strand of hair back from Natalie’s forehead, and nodded. “Of course.” She stretched in place. "Just give me a minute."

She went to the bathroom, brushed her teeth and washed her face before taking her medicine. She dressed slowly while Natalie sat on the bed and waited.

Outside, the city felt unusually hushed for a weekday morning. The air was cool and damp from a night of rain. They started down the sidewalk together, sneakers soft against the pavement. Lottie led. Her pace was lazy and Natalie fell into step just behind her, matching her rhythm exactly. They didn’t speak. Lottie occasionally glanced back to check that she was still there, and Natalie would give a small nod, or adjust her pace wordlessly to give her more space.

When they reached their home again, completing their loop, Lottie looked over and gave Natalie a quiet smile. “You did great.”

Natalie gave a small, winded smile back.

Once upstairs, they took turns in the shower. Natalie went first. Lottie made coffee while she waited. When it was her turn, Lottie stood under the stream for a long time, reciting silent affirmations and intentions for her day as the water ran over her.

They left together a little before nine. Natalie stayed close, almost magnetized. She walked a step behind Lottie on the sidewalk, and kept her eyes down. On the subway platform, she pressed close to Lottie’s side, resting her head on her shoulder as they waited. When the train came, she nestled beside her in the seat, eyes closed but awake. Her fingers brushed Lottie’s once, and Lottie gently took her hand and laced their fingers together. Neither of them spoke.

When the train reached Natalie’s stop, she stirred reluctantly. Lottie turned to her, offering a soft smile.

“You’re going to be okay.” she said, voice low. “I’ll see you soon.”

Natalie met her eyes. “Thank you Lottie.”

Lottie gave her hand one last squeeze before letting go. Natalie stood and stepped off the train

Lottie watched her disappear into the crowd, then turned her head forward, eyes thoughtful as the train pulled away.


The seminar room was cold. A stack of photocopied articles sat at the edge of the table, and Dr. Delgado moved briskly between cables and controls, cueing up a set of slides for discussion.

On the screen: RITUAL AS COGNITIVE SCAFFOLDING

Lottie sat near the middle, her notebook open, pen uncapped. Her mind hovered just outside the room. The ritual group from the night before drifted behind her eyes like a second projection layered over the material world.

“Last week,” Dr. Delgado began, “we talked about shared myth and how collective narratives help bind religious groups by aligning memory, meaning, and behavior.”

She gestured to the screen. “This week, we shift to ritual as a cognitive mechanism.”

There were nods around the table. Lottie’s pen hovered.

Deglado clicked to a new slide and continued. “In cognitive terms ritual doesn’t just express belief. It produces belief. It stabilizes unstable ideas through structure and repetition. If myth tells the story, ritual makes it real.”

Lottie scribbled that phrase down. Stabilizes unstable ideas through structure. Yes. That was it.

Dr. Delgado began pacing slowly. “Ritual provides an external frame that anchors internal experience. It gives repeatable form to affective or ineffable states. Often, people don’t believe until they’ve enacted the belief. Ritual scaffolds cognition by showing the body the shape the mind is supposed to take.”

Lottie’s pen slowed. Her thoughts drifted to Natalie. How she had built the rhythm of surrender into her. How she had drawn her into structure to make space for belief. To let It root.

A student raised a hand. “So... are rituals manipulative? If they’re shaping cognition, isn’t that a kind of trick?”

Dr. Delgado gave a small, knowing smile. “Manipulation is a moral term. Cognition isn’t. Our job is to describe what ritual does, not judge it. That’s theology’s domain, not ours.”

Lottie underlined the words: Not judge it.
Her fingers tapped the pen against the notebook. Describe what ritual does.
She thought of Natalie’s voice the night before... trembling, searching. She thought of the metronome, the taper, the pulse in her throat.

“We also see ritual as a way to offload cognitive burden, especially during anxiety, transition, or grief. It narrows the field of choice to a single course. It removes the burden of agency. And in doing so, it often induces calm.”

Lottie didn’t move. She was listening too closely.

“Ritual creates stability,” Delgado repeated. “It reduces cognitive load. It allows people to inhabit beliefs that might otherwise remain abstract.”

Lottie raised her hand.

“Charlotte.”

Her voice was calm. Measured. “So it’s a form of conditioning. Not Pavlovian, but experiential. Emotional.”

Delago nodded in affirmation. “Exactly. It’s structure imposed on liminality. People in transitional states like conversion, adolescence, or spiritual crisis need frames. Ritual provides that through posture, rhythm, and repetition so that the body begins to believe before the mind catches up.”

Lottie nodded slowly. She could feel the soft tap of her pulse in her wrist. Structure. Repetition. Posture.

“It’s like scaffolding around a building that hasn’t been finished,” another student added. “You move through the form, and eventually it tells you how to be inside it.”

“Exactly.” Delgado agreed. “Ritual makes the invisible visible. The emotional, physical. That’s its cognitive function.”

Lottie copied that line verbatim. Then beneath it, in smaller script:

If they follow structure, belief will follow.
If she repeats, she will align.
It brought me here. It wants this.

As the discussion turned to examples of Zen monks, Orthodox liturgy, and AA meetings, someone brought up the question of authenticity. Lottie didn’t speak again, but her mind was already elsewhere. Back to Natalie, bowed and trembling in her arms. Back to the taper. The metronome. The quiet obedience that shaped her.

Ritual created calm because it removed choice. She’d seen it firsthand. Natalie was always clearest, softest, when she wasn’t trying to decide anything at all. When she let Lottie hold the frame. The strain came only when doubt crept in, when part of her resisted.

But resistance could be quieted. All it required was clarity. And structure. And repetition.

Her hand moved swiftly now, no longer taking notes from the board. She began drafting exercises: ways to ground, focus, align. Anchoring cues. She wasn’t just here to listen. She was here to build something.

Then her thoughts drifted from Natalie outward, to the group. The fractured minds at the bookstore meeting. She tapped her pen, turned to a clean page, and drew a vertical line down the center.

On one side: Delgado’s definitions.
On the other: New practices.

Not for Natalie alone. For them.
They needed structure.
And she knew now—it was her role to build it.


When she returned to the brownstone she went directly to the office and sat at her desk. She took her phone from her bag and dialed Micah’s mother.

“Hello Mrs. Langford, it’s Charlotte.” Her voice was warm, apologetic. “I just wanted to let you know I won’t be able to make today’s lesson. I’m so sorry for the short notice. Nothing serious, just a scheduling conflict I didn’t anticipate.”

A pause, then a soft laugh from the other end. Lottie made a few reassuring sounds, nodded along. “Yes, of course. Thank you for understanding. I’ll see you next week.”

When she hung up, her eyes drifted to the string map on the wall. She replaced her phone and pulled her notebook from her bag and flipped past the seminar notes. She took out the notebook with the symbol on the cover and opened to a blank page.

At the top, she wrote:
GROUP STRUCTURE

Then beneath it:
- Open with unison mantra
- Circle introductions
- Ritual roundtable: Offerings / struggles / insights
- Synthesis (verbal reflection)
- Close with new practice 

She tapped the pen against the paper. What had Delgado said? Offload cognitive burden. Yes. These people didn’t need more questions. They needed sequence and predictability. She would give them that.

She flipped back to her notes from the night before, reading over the scattered phrases and questions the others had shared. She marked several with stars and noted common threads including fear, disorientation, longing. They needed to believe their confusion could be shaped into something. That their openness meant purpose and that their doubt meant they were near truth.

That’s what she would offer them.

Her pen moved faster.

Then, as her hand slowed, her mind circled back, inevitably, to Natalie.

She switched to her ritual notebook and turned to a fresh page. At the top she wrote: NIGHTLY RITUAL - 2

Objectives: 
- Conditioning through kindness
- Reduce confusion through clarity
- Reinforce care and rest
- No spoken suggestions this week
- Gentle affirmations only
- Frame It as loving, not demanding
- Touch, softness, ease

Natalie had said she didn’t feel safe. That something was wrong. But it wasn’t Natalie, it was the pressure and overload. Lottie had given too much, too fast. She knew what that felt like, how unbearable it could become when your own thoughts didn’t feel like your own.

This would be different.

She would give Natalie ease. A break from the dissonance. Enough comfort to keep her anchored and enough structure to keep her held.

She flipped to the page where she’d been drafting suggestion phrases and crossed out the ones she had planned to speak aloud. She wouldn’t push. Not tonight. Only touch. Only rhythm. Only sent suggestions that were loving and affirming. Reinforcing Natalie’s obedience not as demand, but as connection.

She turned back to the page and wrote 6 suggestions to send to Natalie. Satisfied, Lottie set down the pen and exhaled.


Lottie was working on an essay when she heard the key in the front door. She emerged from the office in time to see Natalie step inside, shoulders drooped but eyes lighting when she saw Lottie. Before a single word could be spoken, Lottie bridged the distance—reaching out, pressing her lips softly to Natalie’s in a long, grounding kiss. Natalie melted completely into it, arms winding around Lottie’s waist.

When Lottie finally pulled back, her voice was gentle: “Hi baby. How are you feeling?”

Natalie let out a breath. “Ok.”

Lottie smiled, brushing a strand of hair behind Natalie’s ear, then slipped one arm around her waist. “Come on, let’s sit.” She guided her toward the living room couch with her hand on the samll of her back.

They settled together on the cushions, Natalie curling into Lottie’s side. Lottie tucking an arm around her tightly. She rested her chin atop Natalie’s head.

“How was your theory seminar?” Lottie asked, voice soft.

“Fine.” Natalie squirmed a little, but leaned into the touch. “It was ok.”

“And in the studio today?” Lottie asked, gently rolling the question between caring and concern. “Are you falling behind?”

Natalie turned her head and blinked. Her arms uncurled slightly. “No,” she said softly. “I did what I needed. I finished the model... mostly.” She exhaled. “Thanks for asking.”

Lottie pressed her lips to the top of Natalie’s head. “Good.” She held her a moment more, letting the quiet settle between them.

When she spoke again, her tone was confident: “What do you feel like doing now?”

She didn’t have to wait long. Natalie's eyes looked up to her, glaze softening. “Whatever you want.”

Lottie brushed her cheek gently. “Ok.” She paused, thinking of something. “How about we go to the Morgan Library and Museum? The building’s beautiful, warm wood and quiet light. I think you'll appreciate some quiet and beauty.”

Natalie broke a small smile. “That sounds really nice.”

Lottie squeezed her. “Let me know when you’re ready. We’ll head out when you're ready.”

Natalie nodded, easing against Lottie’s side, the tension visibly softening. The day of calm had begun.


The Morgan Library was quiet when they arrived, its Beaux-Arts facade standing serene beneath the crisp sky. Inside, the hush of polished stone and old wood seemed to swallow their footsteps. Natalie stayed close to Lottie as they crossed the threshold, letting herself be guided through the ticket line, through the entrance to the galleries.

The exhibition rooms glowed softly with amber light, early afternoon seeping through the high arched windows. On view was Master Drawings from the Musée Carnavalet, a temporary exhibition on loan from Paris. The selections were intimate and immediate: quick graphite studies of Parisian street scenes, architectural elevations, costumed figures rendered in faint brown ink.

They moved slowly, hand-in-hand at first, then pausing separately before particular works. Lottie lingered before a drawing of a procession in Place de la Bastille, while Natalie stopped in front of a delicate architectural elevation of an early ink and watercolor study of a Parisian hotel particulier. She studied the symmetry of it, the precise lines of the cornices, the central axis balanced by twin columns and mirrored pediments. The render was incomplete in places, the ink fading near the base as if the artist had changed their mind mid-stroke. But the intention was still there. The proportions still held.

She tilted her head. “It’s like... it’s waiting to be finished.”

Lottie came to stand beside her. “Or maybe it’s already finished, just not fully revealed.”

Natalie looked at her. “You think so?”

They wandered through the rest of the collection in silence, letting the restraint of line and light induce quiet between them. Then they made their way to the reading room. It was one of Lottie’s favorite spaces in the city: high ceilings, dark paneling, and the almost sacred hush of a room built to be occupied by focused minds.

They found a table near the window in the Morgan’s reading room, afternoon light slanted through the high glass panes, casting long shadows across the table’s oak surface. Lottie set down her books and passed one across to Natalie: A Geometry of Music by Dmitri Tymoczko. The title alone had made her think of Natalie and of the way her mind parsed space and form instinctively, of the way music and structure seemed to converge in her body like second nature.

Natalie opened the book without hesitation, flipping through the pages with quiet focus. Lottie watched as her eyes traced the diagrams of spirals of pitch space, latticed maps of tonal relationships, triangular webs of harmony. She didn’t ask questions, didn’t frown in confusion. She just looked and bsorbed. Her fingers hovered over one of the more intricate diagrams, then gently traced a path through it.

It seemed to calm her. The symmetry. The balance. Lottie could see it in the way Natalie’s shoulders lowered, the way her breathing slowed just slightly.

Lottie pulled a pen from her bag and began to read. Her theological text was dense, its margin already scribbled with notes. She jotted new observations beside underlined passages. Ritual is the symbolic orchestration of anxiety. She copied the phrase out and circled it twice.

After a few minutes, Natalie set the book aside and pulled her sketchpad into her lap. Her pencil moved tentatively at first in light strokes, drawing cautious angles. But soon she found rhythm. Lottie watched as her hand steadied, as her lines grew bolder, more decisive.

She was sketching the room. The curved arch of the window, the repeating crown molding along the ceiling, the way the lamps cast crosshatched shadows across the polished floor. It was interpretive. Natalie wasn’t copying what she saw so much as deciphering it, extracting its rules, its hidden structure.

Lottie leaned back in her chair, pretending to return to her book, but her eyes kept drifting. She caught glimpses of Natalie’s margin notes, short fragments of thought etched between floorplans and shading: light cuts across the molding like a rib, arches mirror each other without touching, repetition settles the mind.

It made something settle in Lottie too. Natalie wasn’t lost, she was translating. Finding the right language. One built from light, and structure, and pattern. One that Lottie understood.

Lottie returned to her book and read in silence, one hand moving occasionally to underline a passage or scribble a note in the margin of her own book. She felt the hum of alignment. Like they were meant to be here. Like something in this room had always been waiting for them.

Natalie tugged her sleeve gently after a while and showed her a drawing of Lottie herself, bent over her book, half-illuminated by light from the window. The lines were soft and affectionate.

“You always look like that when you’re studying,” Natalie whispered.

“Like what?”

“Like you already know the answers.”

Lottie smiled and leaned over to kiss her.

They stayed there another hour, reading and writing and sketching, letting the structure of the room hold them. And when they finally rose to leave, Natalie tucked her sketchpad under her arm and followed just half a step behind Lottie, peaceful for the first time in days.


They walked side by side beneath the amber glow of the streetlights, the cool evening air pressing gently against their skin. Lottie held Natalie’s hand, her thumb brushing back and forth across the knuckles in slow, lazy arcs. The afternoon had gone right. She could feel it in the looseness of Natalie’s shoulders, the ease in her gait.

Then Natalie’s phone buzzed in her jacket pocket.

She let go of Lottie’s hand to pull it free, squinting at the screen before answering. “Hey Van,” she said, her voice light, warmer than Lottie had heard it in days.

Lottie watched as she listened, her gaze drifting up to the sky, then back down to Natalie’s face.

“Yeah, I’m good. How're you?” 

...

“Out with Lottie.”

...

“We miss you too.”

...

“Uh... I’m not sure, let me ask.”

Natalie turned to her. “Van wants to know if we want to go to a get-together tomorrow night.”

Lottie smiled. “Sure, sounds fun.”

Natalie nodded and brought the phone back up. “Yeah, we’re in.” 

...

“Okay, let me write it down.”

She pulled out her sketchbook. Lottie peeked over her shoulder and caught the rapid scribble of an address and time.

“Ok. See you then.”

She ended the call and slid the phone back into her pocket, slipping her hand into Lottie’s again without a word.


The brownstone was quiet when they returned. Lottie slipped off her shoes and reached for Natalie’s jacket, easing it from her shoulders with gentle fingers. Natalie let her, tilting her head to the side with a quiet smile, pliant and soft in her hands.

They settled on the couch without speaking, bodies naturally folding into the familiar shape they always took: Natalie curled toward her, knees tucked beneath her, her hand sliding beneath Lottie’s shirt to rest lightly on her waist. Lottie kissed her temple, then again just above the cheekbone. Natalie turned her face, lips already parted, meeting her in a kiss that deepened before either of them could pause.

Natalie kissed like she was offering something, and Lottie took it, mouth coaxing hers open further, tongue gliding over the seam of her lips with a slow, patient hunger. Natalie responded easily and pliantly. Lottie's hand drifting up Natalie’s side to rest at her collarbone, thumb pressing lightly against her throat.

The contact made Natalie’s breath hitch.

Lottie let herself sink into it. She could feel her surrender in the way Natalie’s mouth stayed open under hers, the way her spine curved toward her, yielding with the ease of someone used to being guided. It thrilled her, this softness. This trained devotion. This body that had learned, day after day, how to respond. 

Lottie deepened the kiss, slid a hand beneath Natalie’s shirt, palm gliding over the warm plane of her back. Natalie made a quiet sound that loosened something in Lottie’s chest. Her other hand cupped Natalie’s jaw, angling her perfectly and Natalie's mouth following eagerly.

She pressed Natalie down into the couch cushions, just enough to let her weight register, and Natalie let out a breath like release. Lottie could feel how she just wanted to be held, to be moved, to be given something to follow.

Lottie kissed her again, longer this time, letting her hips press forward slightly, just enough for the tension to bloom between them. Natalie arched into it reflexively, her breath catching against Lottie’s mouth. Her hand at Lottie’s waist slid lower, fingertips grazing the top of her jeans. Lottie felt heat pool low in her belly. Her pulse had quickened. She was wet.

Then a low growl broke the moment. Natalie’s stomach, unmistakable in the silence. She froze.

Lottie didn’t address it. She simply pressed a light kiss to Natalie’s forehead and spoke gently. “I think I’d like to play for a bit.”

Natalie blinked up at her, disoriented.

“And you...” Lottie ran kisses down her neck. “You could sketch while I do. Keep your hands busy. It might help settle your mind before we start the gaze work.”

Natalie nodded slowly. “Yes Lottie.”

She could still feel Natalie’s body beneath her, the echo of heat and willing stillness. She crossed the room and sat at the piano bench. Behind her, she heard the faint rustle of paper, the scratch of graphite, the sound of Natalie's quiet obedience.

Lottie didn’t choose a piece. She simply placed her hands on the piano and let them drift. A minor triad unfolded first—unsteady, unresolved. Then a fifth beneath it. Her left hand anchored as her right moved delicately, feeling its way forward without certainty. The notes were soft, a little broken at first, but they found each other.

She breathed in slowly and exhaled with the chord change. The weight of her body settled into the bench. Her spine softened. She let it guide her, each progression a question, then an answer. The intervals pulled something from her chest, note by note, loosening threads from a knot.

She felt the hollowness in her stomach that she hadn’t addressed all day and leaned into it. It made her alert. Aware. Alive in her body. She imagined Natalie pencil to paper, head bowed in quiet obedience, feeling the same hunger. They were aligned, Lottie thought. Cleansed by want. Synchronized by lack.

Her fingers pressed down with more certainty now. A minor seventh. A chromatic climb. The dissonance lingered just long enough to sharpen the release. The music fed her. Not her stomach, but some inner space that needed structure, motion, sound. She could feel the air vibrating around her fingers. Her breath slowed.

Then she heard It between the notes. *She’s opening.*

Lottie didn’t pause. Her left hand dropped to a deeper register. Her right smoothed across an arpeggio.

The voice curved around and inside the melody, resonating behind her ears. *You've done well.*

“She’s better now.” Lottie was barely audible over the music. “I’m keeping her close.”

She’s hungry.

Lottie’s eyes closed. Her fingers floated higher on the keys, notes thinning into something almost fragile.

“I know,” she whispered. “I feel it too.”

There was no answer. Just the hum of It receding back into the quiet, leaving her with the music, the ache in her belly, and the soft certainty that Natalie’s hunger was sacred because it mirrored her own.


The last chord faded slowly, the strings inside the piano still shivering with resonance as her fingers lifted. Lottie exhaled through her nose, letting the silence settle. Her body ached in small, pleasant ways, her shoulders were loose from the hour of playing, her stomach still hollow but quiet now, tamed.

She rose from the bench and padded into the kitchen.

Natalie sat at the table, her sketchbook open, posture bent and relaxed. She didn’t look up when Lottie stepped behind her. Her pencil moved in slow, controlled strokes, her tongue just slightly caught between her lips in concentration.

Lottie placed a hand gently on each shoulder. Natalie stilled but didn’t flinch. Lottie bent down and kissed the crown of her head, then let her eyes drift to the page.

There, in fine graphite lines, was a quiet room rendered in soft perspective. It looked almost like a chapel, but not quite. The walls curved inward, gently tapering, folding themselves into hush. A round skylight spilled imagined light down onto a central stone bench. Along the interior perimeter, a circular groove seemed to delineate some kind of path without a clear destination. Inside the space, everything felt quietly contained.

Lottie’s gaze moved to the lower edge of the paper. There, smaller, but rendered with loving detail, was a sketch of Lottie herself, at the piano, shoulders relaxed, eyes downturned, mid-phrase.

“You’re incredible.” Lottie said softly, her thumbs stroking gently along Natalie’s arms. “You always see the truth of things.”

Natalie tilted her head slightly toward the touch.

“I love the skylight. It feels like… guidance. Like something watching over, but gently.”

Natalie nodded, not speaking. Her face was relaxed in profile. No visible tension, no trace of yesterday's tears. Lottie could see the edge of sleep around her eyes, like she was hovering in that soft, post-creative space.

“Come shower. It'll feel good.”

Natalie turned her head slightly, looking up at her. “Will you come too?”

Lottie smiled. “Of course.”

She reached down, took Natalie’s hand, and led her upstairs. The steps creaked softly underfoot. The bathroom light was low and warm. They undressed without hurry. In the shower, there was no urgency, just touch, steam, and the gentle rhythm of water. Lottie washed Natalie’s hair for her, combing her fingers through carefully, tilting her head back into the spray.

Afterward, they descended to the office. Lottie crossed to the window sill to light the incense. Behind her, she heard Natalie settle onto her cushion with a quiet breath, her presence steady and waiting.

Lottie lowered herself onto the cushion across from Natalie and settled into place, legs folded neatly beneath her. She lit the taper between them, its narrow flame rising slow and steady, casting a soft golden glow across Natalie’s face.

Lottie opened her notebook and turned to a fresh page. She looked up at Natalie, who was already watching her with a softened, settled gaze.

“Ok.” Lottie said gently, pen poised. “Same questions as always.”

Natalie gave a slight nod.

“How grounded do you feel in your body?”

"9." Natalie considered. "I think the hunger helps. I feel it in my stomach, and it kind of pulls me down into myself. Like... a reminder I'm in my body, not floating outside it.”

Lottie nodded, jotting it down.

“How calm or at ease do you feel right now?”

“8.” Natalie said after only a beat. “The piano really helps." She gave a faint smile. 

Lottie let that smile echo back at her.

“How open do you feel to being guided?”

Natalie’s eyes flicked downward, thoughtful. “8 again. It’s... not like yesterday. I think I needed today. The quiet. And you.” Her voice lowered. “I want to keep following.”

Lottie’s pen paused for just a second. She felt the words settle in her chest like balm. She wrote them down.
“How connected do you feel to me in this moment?”

Natalie’s gaze didn’t waver. “9.” she said again. “More than I have in a few days. This evenin gwas nice. You playing, and me sketching. It was like we were in sync.”

Lottie nodded softly, keeping her expression even despite the small bloom of satisfaction.

“And how present does It feel?”

Natalie exhaled through her nose. “2... or maybe 3. It’s been quiet. I think because I’ve been with you. It’s like...maybe It's waiting? Or maybe It trusts you.” Her brow pinched slightly. “Either way, it hasn’t been loud.”

Lottie wrote that down last, the edges of her mouth still gently upturned. She looked up and met Natalie’s gaze across the flame.

“Ok. Are you ready?
