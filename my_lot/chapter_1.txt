Lottie stirred before the sun rose fully, alone in bed. She stayed still for a moment, listening. The bathroom sink ran for a few seconds, then stopped. The sound of the drawer opening, a bag unzipping and zipping again. A pause. Then tenis shoes squeaking down the stairs and the faint sound of the front door opening, clicking closed, and locking.

She looked at the clock. Nearly 6. She sighed. Natalie’s body had been restless all night, her breathing shallow and uneven in sleep. Lottie had felt her body in her arms: tension humming low in her limbs, heart rate picking up and slowing with waves of axiety. She hadn’t asked outright, but she knew. First day nerves. A new building, new instructors, new names to remember. Natalie had been calm on the surface all weekend, but Lottie recognized the familiar signs in her: seeking direction frequently, not speaking unless addressed. The look in her eyes that belied a internal cacophony she was fighting to quiet.

Lottie pushed the blankets back and stood. She moved first to the bathroom, flipping on the light. Her reflection was still and pale, hair slightly flattened on one side, the fine ridges of pillow-crease across her cheek. She tied her hair into a loose knot, smoothed the creases with cool water, washed her face in silence. She dried gently, then opened the mirrored cabinet and took her medication, swallowing one pill with a sip from the glass by the sink. She showered and dressed and checked herself in the mirror again. She nodded and smiled. The first small ritual of her day, complete.

She made the bed then continued downstairs. The kitchen was quiet. Lottie moved barefoot across the tile and began assembling what she needed—eggs, cream, fresh spinach, butter, a block of cheese. She moved methodically, humming quietly, her knife sliding through the leaves with soft rhythm. She focused on the quiet sounds. Knife against cutting board. The soft rhythm of whisking. Oil warming in the pan. The realness of it gave her confidence. The morning began to solidify. She knew it was what Natalie needed to feel anchored, grounded, and nourished.

By the time the first omelet was just starting to puff at the edges, the front door clicked open again. Lottie didn’t turn. “Welcome back, baby.”

Natalie approached behind her and kissed her shoulder. "What is all this?"

“I started breakfast. Sit. You’ll feel better.”

“Can I shower first?"

“Of course.” Lottie turned and smiled at her. “I’ll have coffee poured when you’re back.”

Natalie nodded. "I'll be quick."

Lottie set the table meticulously and plated her omelet. She began Natalie's next, making it second to be sure hers was hot when they ate. When she heard Natalie descending the stairs, she moved to the table and slid the omelet from the pan.

Natalie paused at the table, taking in the spread. “This looks delicious. Thank you Lottie.” 

“My pleasure. I wanted you to feel strong today.” She kissed her head.

Natalie gave a faint smile, already lowering herself into the chair. She touched the edge of her fork, and looked up.

Lottie sat and met her eyes. "Bon Appetit."

A few moments passed as they ate. Lottie considered her next words carefully then spoke. "Big day. How do you feel?" She knew already what Natalie was going to say.

“I don’t know.” She sighed. “I feel that... feeling. When I don't know what comes next.”

Lottie nodded. “I know. You're anxious.” She tapped the coffee in front of her, encouraging her to drink. “That's ok. You don’t have to know everything on your first day. You just have to go.”

Natalie looked up at her and took the coffee in her hand. "Thank you Lottie." She drank then took another bite. "This is really good."

Lottie smiled softly. “Good. I'm glad you like it." She met Natalie’s eyes and felt that familiar tether between them. "Just remember: put in the time you need to and you’ll be fine.” She saw when the words landed in her and smiled.

“How do you always know what to say?” 

“It’s a gift.”

They left together not long after, walking the few blocks to the train. Natalie stayed quiet on the ride, her bag tucked on her lap, hands resting in it lightly. Lottie kept her hand in hers, thumb tracing her watch strap. She felt the moisture in her palm. “First days aren’t for being perfect. They're for being present. Stay focused in the moment.”

As they neared the stop for Pratt, Natalie adjusted her strap and stood, nerves flickering again across her features. “I’ll see you at dinner?”

“Of course.” Lottie said. “I should be home early. I'll have it ready.”

Natalie gave her a small nod, then slipped through the doors onto the platform.

She watched as Natalie walked toward the gates, and admired the quiet determination in her step. Then she turned her gaze forward, the train already moving, already pulling her north.


Lottie stepped off the train at Columbus Circle just after nine. She kept her pace unhurried, crossing the plaza to Fordham’s entrance, weaving between other students, most of them younger, louder, more disheveled than she remembered being.

Her routine was steady. Upstairs to the student lounge. She made herself coffee, added one sugar, and took a corner table by the window. From her bag, she pulled out a slim leather notebook, her pen, and a printed copy of the program guidelines for the BA/MA bridge.

Wednesday’s meeting with Dr. Riis loomed like a marker in her week. She liked deadlines. She saw them as firm points in the future to look towards. Her thesis was not a test; it was an opportunity. A chance to name the thing that had been quietly forming in her mind for months.

She uncapped her pen and began to write in perfect script.

## Proposal: Toward a Syncretic Cosmology of Human Purpose.

Below that, a series of bullet points, flowing easily:

- Axis mundi / sacred center as recurring archetype

- Cyclical vs. linear conceptions of time

- Convergence of monotheistic “will of God” and animistic “spirit-in-everything”

- Patterns of divine communication through chosen agents

- Case study comparison: early Christian mystics / Yoruba orisha possession / modern UFO religions

She paused and rolled the pen between her thumb and forefinger.

And then, lower, almost in the margin:

>> “It” as unifying presence. Not metaphor. Obscured reality.

She drew a faint circle around it. Her anchor. The idea too large to name fully yet. But already she knew: this was the spine. A warmth filled her chest as she looked down at the page. Alignment. As though her mind had been waiting for her to give it permission to begin.

After a while she reached into her bag and retrieved her laptop. She was ready to put her notes into a structure. 

She began writing an official outline. She referenced Eliade’s The Sacred and the Profane, flagged passages from God is Red, jotted a line from The Myth of the Eternal Return. She opened a folder titled “Thesis” and saved her notes. 

Lottie felt the space around her recede, her thoughts drawing close and quiet. Her pen tapped once, paused. Then flowed again. Her mind began to pursue something that felt strange in a way. Like a memory. A pattern. Something that had shown itself again and again in her reading, her classes, her quiet meditations: the same shapes recurring across time, across cultures, across boundaries that should have rendered them unrelated and incompatible.

She opened her notes from the prior semester and copied down a quote she’d underlined twice back in April:

>> “All religious experience begins with the conviction that something more exists, beyond the visible world.”

More. Always more. Something coherent. Something directional. Not chaos—design. That’s what she wanted to explore. The convergence of mythology, of cosmology, into an idea that was not just structure, but intention. Human beings orienting their lives around a sense of order they might not be inventing, but discovering.

She switched back to her new document and began laying out her sections:

1. Sacred Center & Axis Mundi

2. Sacred Time: Cycles, Returns, Eternal Recurrence

3. Chosen Figures: Mystics, Prophets, Saints, Receivers

4. Syncretism Across Cultures: The Pattern Beneath the Names

5. Toward a Unified Principle: “It” as Archetype or Reality?

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard after typing the final line. Then she added one more section heading, on impulse:

6. Personal Reflections: Intuition, Symbol, and the Thin Veil

She stared at that last one. The most un-academic phrase on the page. But it felt… necessary. Inevitable. Not indulgent or  tangential. Just honest. She took a breath and nodded.

She felt in her bones what she was endeavoring to articulate wasn’t just study. It was truth. There had been too many nights where she had felt something weighing in her thoughts. Too many moments when a symbol or phrase would leap out from a text like it had been waiting for her. She felt a faint shimmering sense that things were beginning to cohere not because of her intellect, but because she was paying attention in the right way.

Her eyes drifted to the margin, where she had circled the word “It.”

She felt a faint pulse of certainty. The idea had been waiting for her to find it.

She closed her eyes for a moment and willed herself to stillness. She evened her breath. She quieted her thoughts. She felt it remain... something at the core of her clicking into place.


Comparative Religion was held in a narrow, sunlit room with tall windows that overlooked a brick courtyard. Lottie sat in the front row near a window, a fresh page open in her notebook before her. She wrote the date neatly at the top, underlining it with a calm hand.

Dr. Maier entered briskly, sleeves rolled, and began with a question: “Why do so many cultures tie spiritual transformation to physical ritual?” He moved straight into examples. Initiation ceremonies, sacrificial rites, fasting, pilgrimage. The shape of the lecture was familiar but Lottie felt herself become unusually engrossed.

As the professor discussed symbolic death and rebirth, she underlined a phrase in her notes: thresholds of identity. Next to it, in smaller script: passage by repetition, ritual.

She looked down at the note for a long second. Then wrote, almost idly: When does ritual become functional and not just symbolic? 

She let the question linger.

Professor Maier had moved on to discuss axis mundi imagery in ancient cosmologies—trees, mountains, ziggurats—as ways of tethering human life to the divine. “Every culture imagines a central place where the sacred breaks through the profane,” he said. “A way of organizing reality.”

Lottie circled central place in her notes, then drew a faint vertical line beside it. Then idly, she drew more lines from it, resulting in a shape of a tree. Branches at the top, roots at the bottom. *Recurring form.*

Professor Maier was talking about the Eleusinian Mysteries now—how initiates of the ancient Greek cults described feelings of deep revelation, cosmic alignment, the lifting of a veil. “They believed they had seen the structure of the world,” he said. “And after that, they were no longer afraid of death.”

Lottie’s fingers tightened slightly around her pen. She exhaled quietly. Let her shoulders relax. She looked down at what she’d written and drew a small symbol next to it—just a circle, bisected by a vertical line. Axis mundi. Her shorthand.

The lecture continued, now touching on sacred time—ritual calendars, festivals that marked returns. The idea of eternity not as a line, but a loop. Lottie’s mind drifted, but not away. Deeper.

She thought of the texts she’d reread that morning. Of how often disparate cultures arrived at the same structure, without contact, without shared language. A pattern not just across space, but time.

It revelaed through ritual? She wrote it in the margins then blinked at what she’d written. She considered striking it out. But she didn’t. Instead, she turned the page of her notebook to a fresh page and kept on.

The professor’s voice carried on, warm and measured. But Lottie just stared out the window now, eyes following the slow turn of a leaf as it drifted to the courtyard below. 

*The world has patterns. You just have to know where to look.*


After class, students filtered out in clusters, their conversation quickly turning to mundane concerns like exams and subway delays. Lottie lingered, packing her notebook slowly, waiting until the last student had slipped through the door.

Dr. Maier was erasing the blackboard when she approached. “Excuse me."

He turned and smiled. “Ah, Charlotte. What can I do for you?”

She spoke confidently and looked at the professor directly. “I’ve been thinking about what you said today. About how different cultures develop similar ritual forms. The… convergence.”

He nodded. “Yes. Archetypes can be uncanny that way.”

“So what is it, then? Why do the forms recur?” She leaned lightly against the desk. “Why does it always come back to the mountain, or the tree, or the circle? Even when there’s no contact between societies?”

He considered her for a beat, then set the eraser down. “I would say that's the very question we're trying to answer. Why is it that metaphor forms something foundational for societies, time and again?”

She nodded. “Right. Like it’s not just symbol, but… structure.”

“Do you mean psychological structure, or metaphysical?”

She gave a small smile. “Both?”

He chuckled. “That’s usually how these things go.”

There was a pause. Lottie tapped her fingers on the lecturn. “I’ve been outlining my thesis proposal. For Dr. Riis. It’s still early but… this keeps surfacing.”

Dr. Maier tilted his head. “So this is part of it?”

She nodded. “The overlap. Sacred centers, sacred time. Patterns that echo even when the belief systems are wildly different. I keep wondering if they’re not echoing each other, but maybe something else.”

He studied her a moment longer, then said with quiet assurance, “That’s a powerful line of inquiry. Just be careful not to chase certainty too soon on an idea that is so broad. Let the shape reveal itself.”

She maintained eye contact with him as she considered his advice. “Yes, sir.”

Dr. Maier smiled. “You’ve got good instincts. I look forward to seeing where you take it.”

“Thank you.” Lottie felt a flicker of warmth in her chest, gratitude and affirmation threading together. “Have a good afternoon, Professor.”

“You too, Charlotte.”

She stepped out into the hall, her pace unhurried, but her mind electric.


The late afternoon light was warm and slanted as Lottie climbed the steps of the subway. She adjusted her strap and pulled out her phone, dialing Natalie.

It rang twice.

“Hey.” Natalie was alert and a little breathless.

“Hi baby.” Lottie smiled instinctively. “How was orientation?”

“It was actually... really good.” Natalie exhaled a small laugh. “There was a lot, but I’m excited. I got my studio assignment and my full schedule. Everyone was nice, the studio’s huge. My desk is by a window.”

Lottie pictured it clearly. Natalie curled over a drafting board, brow furrowed in focus, head tilted in thought, light catching the edge of her cheekbone. “That sounds perfect.”

“Yeah." She laughed again. "It’s so real now and it feels so... correct. Like I belong there.”

“I’m glad, Nat. I’m so proud of you.”

"Thanks Lot. couldn't have done it without you." She paused. “So hey, I’m stopping to grab some supplies on the way home. I’ll be back soon. Do you need anything?”

"No, but thank you for asking. I'll see you soon?"

“Yeah. See you soon."

They said goodbye, and Lottie closed her phone and tucked the warmth of Natalie’s voice deep.

The brownstone greeted her with stillness. The air held the scent of sautéed spinach and butter. She breathed it in and smiled faintly, then walked to the front window and unlatched it, letting in a cooling breeze. Outside, the wind chime stirred with the soft sounds of early autumn.

She didn’t bother with the lights. The gold of the day’s end filled the living room in streaks, casting slow-moving shadows of leaves across the hardwood floor. She paused, watching the light shift. The space felt gently rearranged by it.

Lottie took her bag into the office and deposited her notebooks onto the desk. Her thoughts drifted gently back to her morning planning session, to her margin notes, to the questions that still hovered, unanswered but pulsing with potential.

She didn’t rush toward the next task. The stillness between rituals joined them together. They were the part of the rhythm that made space for thought, for presence, for devotion. She stood in it, breathed in deeply, and then stepped into the kitchen to begin again.


The door opened softly, hinges creaking in the quiet. Natalie stepped inside, brown paper bag in one arm, and paused. The apartment smelled warm and earthy, faintly herbal. The table was set with steam rising gently from the serving dishes. She exhaled and smiled. “Lottie?”

No answer.

She set her bags by the door, toed off her shoes, and padded toward the office. The door was ajar. She knocked twice on the frame. “Hey Lot. You ready to eat?”

Lottie looked up, blinking slowly as if surfacing from underwater. “Oh, hi baby. I didn’t hear you come in.”

Natalie leaned into the doorframe. “I figured. Doing some studying?”

Lottie nodded, smoothing her notebook closed with one hand. “Just a bit. Dinner should still be hot.”

“I’m sorry I’m late.”

“You’re not late.” Lottie stood and brought her into a soft kiss. “But I'm hungry. Let's eat.”

Lottie took Nat by the hand and led her to the kitchen. She took her seat and watched as Natalie poured them each a glass of water before sitting herself. When she looked up, Lottie nodded and gave the cue, "Bon Appetit."

Natalie began by serving Lottie first, then herself. Chicken thighs, roasted carrots, something creamy and green beneath it all that smelled like shallots and tarragon.

“This looks amazing, as always. Thank you for dinner.”

“You're welcome Natalie." Lottie gave her a quiet smile. "It seems like you had a good first day. What's your schedule like?”

Natalie took a sip of water, then stood to retrieve a handout from her bag by the door. She began reading and speaking as she found her seat again. “Okay, so I’ve got Design Studio Mondays and Wednesdays, all afternoon and into the evening, with critiques on Wednesdays only.” Natalie paused. "They want us taking the studio time very seriously, obviously. They told us design is our new religion." She laughed.

“Good.” Lottie smiled. “It should be.”

"Tuesdays are kind of crazy. Visual Studies in the mornings and Building Materials right after that, then more studio time in the afternoon into the evening. Thursdays I have a seminar called Architectural Thinking in the morning followed by Model building, but no studio time.” She glanced down at the sheet. “Fridays are free, kind of. No lectures, just model building and no studio, but they said that we should use that day to make tweaks on assignments. Saturdays are like that too, I guess. We have studio time all day in case we need to play catch-up.”

Lottie nodded thoughtfully. “What time are your Mondays over?”

“Should be around 6 if I get an early enough start. No critique.”

“I think tonight you should write it all down on a calendar. Did you pick up a planner, by any chance?"

"Yes Lottie."

She smiled. "Good girl. Please include Monday night dinner in your schedule,” Lottie said. “so I don’t miss you too much.”

Natalie smiled and nodded. “Mondays and Thursdays.”

“Perfect.”

They ate quietly for a few moments. Natalie picked at her vegetables then looked up. “How was your day, Lot?" 

"It was good, Natalie. Thank you for asking."

"Did you meet with your advisor today? About your thesis?”

Lottie shook her head. “Not until Wednesday. But I got a good amount of planning done this morning.”

Natalie nodded slowly. “That’s good.”

“It was. It felt right.” Lottie looked up to refill their water glasses and caught Natalie's gaze on her. She focused on it. “This year’s going to be good. For both of us.”

Lottie felt the warmth in Natalie's eyes before her smile reached her face. “It will be good.”


As Natalie rose to start clearing the table, Lottie remained seated, contemplative. She took a sip of water and glanced up. “Can I ask you something?”

Natalie responded as she brought plates to the sink. “Yeah, of course.”

Lottie tilted her head slightly, thoughtful. “Do you ever feel like... when you have a routine, or certain habits we return to... does it ever make you feel... closer to something?”

“Closer to something...” she echoed, her head moving side to side slightly in thought. “I don’t know. I never really thought about it like that.”

"I don’t mean anything specifically, but... something bigger. Or deeper." Lottie waited patiently, watching her think and work.

“I guess… yeah." Natalie spoke slowly. "But I think it's more like... further from something. Further from confusion, or chaos." She paused, the thought coalescing. "Like I’m not floating or scrambling. Like I’m connected to what matters. Like the routine keeps me focused on what’s important.”

She turned and looked to Lottie, steady. “Like you.”


The plates were rinsed and stacked by the sink. Lottie dried her hands while Natalie brought her bag from the door to the table and unzipped it. She retrieved a slim, black spiral-bound planner and a thin stack of orientation handouts.

Lottie wiped down the table as Natalie flipped through her schedule with a quiet frown of concentration. She uncapped a pen and began penciling notes into the week’s boxes, the neat columns slowly filling with reminders and lecture titles.

Lottie moved to the other room, and sat at the piano bench. She didn’t play anything conciously, just let her fingers fall gently to the keys. A low C, then an open fifth. Her hand shifted into a simple voicing. Major sevenths, sus chords, soft pedal down. The music drifted between calm and unresolved, a slow rubato stretching between phrases. Then came a restless flutter... modulations, chromatic tension. A breath held.

She pulled her hands back and let the tones fade. The silence felt deeper for the notes it had replaced. Lottie stood and returned to the office. She opened her notebook, the one from that morning, and turned to a clean page. In small script, she wrote:

Evening notes:
- Ritual as gravity
- Routine = structure = space to hold what matters
- Pull away from chaos = orientation toward meaning

She paused.

Then, almost without thinking, she drew a faint circle in the margin. The same as before.

Her pen hovered.

Then beneath:
Not closer to “It” but protected from what "It" isn’t.

She looked at the page for a moment longer before setting the pen down gently. In the other room, she could hear the soft shuffle of Natalie turning the pages of her planner. She smiled.

Lottie rose and moved softly through the doorway and into the kitchen. She leaned against the threshold for a moment, just watching.

Natalie sat with her elbows on the table, head tilted down toward her planner. She had a pen in one hand and a folded sheet of paper in the other, cross-referencing, nodding to an unseen beat as she worked. Her movements were methodical. Neat handwriting, sharp corners, clean lines drawn across days of the week, separating them into clear sections.

Lottie felt a pull in her chest. Reverence.

She crossed the floor and took the seat beside her, saying nothing at first. Just letting the quiet hang, comfortable and close.

After a beat, she kissed her temple and spoke softly. “Are you tired?”

Natalie didn’t look up right away. She finished scribbling something then turned toward Lottie, with a knowing glint in her eye.

“It’s only my first day, Lot.” Her tone dry with wit but warm. “I haven’t earned the right to be tired yet.”

Lottie smiled. Her voice, when it came, was lower, a little rough at the edges. “Do you want to shower with me before bed?”

The invitation landed with a slow stillness between them. Natalie didn’t answer immediately, but her gaze stayed steady.

A small smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. “Yes Lottie.”
