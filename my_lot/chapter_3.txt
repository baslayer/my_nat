Lottie stirred to the sound of the front door shutting. Morning light spilled across the ceiling in soft gray bands. Natalie was already out on her run.

She sat up slowly, sheets falling away, and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Her eye caught something on the floor, just beside the nightstand. The strap.

She reached down and picked it up, the leather cool against her fingers. It still held the faintest warmth and pliant give from the night before. She held it for a long moment, thumb drifting over the smooth edge. She thought about how the voice had been with her, deep and humming, not urgent or commanding, but there. She took a deep breath. 

Now, the silence was total. Her mind was quiet.

She stood and crossed to the bathroom, taking the harness with her. The cool tiles woke the arches of her feet as she bent over the sink. She worked methodically, cleaning and drying gently. She felt a kind of reverence. She considered how she’d thought she felt It move through her. Like she was conduit, not just self. The toy in her hand suddenly felt weightier, as if it were something sacred. When she was done, she gently and folded it back into its place in the drawer.

Only then did she return to the bathroom to pour a glass of water, take her medication, and rinse her face clean. The water was cold and bracing, and her reflection stared back at her from the mirror. Golden-skinned and dark-eyed, she felt a pang of narcissistic satisfaction. She didn’t look haunted. She didn’t feel haunted. She felt good.

She took a quick shower, just long enough to warm her muscles and rinse the sleep from her skin.

Downstairs, the kitchen was quiet, just the soft clink of the pot as she stirred. The oats thickened slowly on the stove. She added a splash of milk, a swirl of honey, cinnamon. She added the berries, dark and collapsing into the heat, when she heard the door.

Natalie’s shirt was darkened at the collar, her cheeks flushed. She approched and gave Lottie quick kiss before heading upstairs. "Looks good. I'm starved." 

She returned dressed with her bag in tow, depositing it by the door before moving quietly into the kitchen. Her posture was tight and her movements energized as she began setting the table for breakfast. 

Lottie smiled at the feeling of the nervous energy emanating from her. “Are you excited?"

"More like, nervous as hell." Natalie gave her a big grin as she sat at the table, sitting on the edge of her seat. "I feel like ti could go either way. They gave us a prompt about ‘shelter as identity,’ so I’ve been sketching these, like, modular forms that can shift depending on how someone lives... or hides. Mine’s kind of brutalist right now, a lot of concrete and shadow. I think I’m accidentally designing a bunker." She laughed.

"Maybe that’s not accidental. Self expression through design, right?" She poured oats into each of their bowls, depostied the pot back on the stove, and looked to Natalie. "Bon Appetit"

Lottie felt Natalie's eyes on her as she ate. "What about you? Big day, right? When are you meeting Dr. Riis?"

“I feel good about it, honestly. The outline’s solid. The stucture I mapped has was easy to flesh out. I've backed it with enough foundational theory. It’s not just a hunch anymore, it’s taking shape. I think Riis will see that. I’ve been careful with what I’ve chosen to build it on.”

"Let's hope it's a good day for both of us."

Lottie felt sure. "It will be."


On the subway, they stood close. Natalie gripping the pole and swaying, Lottie sitting with her hand on Natalie's hip. They rode together quietly.

When the train slowed to her, Natalie shifted.

“You good?” she asked, gaze flicking over Lottie’s face.

Lottie nodded. “I’m good.”

Natalie didn’t move for a beat. Her eyes lingered, searching. Yesterday still clung around the edges, not fully spoken. Lottie reached for her hand, brushed her thumb lightly over Natalie’s knuckles. “It’s okay.” She smiled. “I’m clear today.”

Natalie gave a faint, relieved nod and stepped off as the doors opened. Lottie stayed on the train, eyes settling on her own reflection in the darkened window. She smiled at her reflection, like she knew something no one else did.


Lottie sat upright in the wooden chair across from Dr. Riis’s desk, her notebook open on her lap, pen in hand. She kept her spine straight, eyes on her advisor, steady and still as the pages turned.

Riis flipped the cover sheet of Lottie’s proposal with one long finger, nodding as she skimmed the content.

“Well,” she said at last, “this is dense. Ambitious.”

Lottie smiled, still. “Thank you.”

“You’re building from Eliade and Durkheim... that’s expected. But I like that you’re situating your argument in tension with them, not under them. That’s something most undergraduates wouldn’t dare.”

Lottie made a small note on her page though she didn’t need to. She had expected that comment. It had come to her the moment she decided to include Durkheim at all. She thought him as useful only as a framework to reject.

“I’m going to push you to bring in Mary Douglas sooner,” Riis continued. “Her purity and danger schema could be invaluable to your second section. You hinted at it in the outline. I want to see it fully unpacked.”

Lottie blinked. The name echoed through her. The man at the bookstore had chosen books of hers.

“I’ve already started rereading her.” Lottie spoke with direct eye contact. “It makes sense to foreground her earlier.”

“Good. And if you’re really serious about syncretic frameworks, you’ll need to acknowledge Turner. Liminality, yes, but also process. Rituals of transition.”

“Yes, ma'am." She took note.

Riis glanced up at her. “You’re not overwhelmed by the scope?”

“No. It’s alive. I just have to keep up.”

That got the faintest smile. Riis reached for her mug. “Well, you’re pulling from serious sources. You’ve made strong choices. There’s clarity in how you’re assembling this.”

Lottie nodded once, her pen resting idle now. There was a hum behind her sternum — not literal, not now, but a kind of vibration in her chest. *You are seen. You are correct. You are following.*

“I will need you to submit a progress report every two weeks,” Riis added, making a note in her own planner. “It’s standard for independent study, but also, realistically, I want to make sure you’re staying focused. Not veering into mysticism for mysticism’s sake.”

Lottie smiled at that. “Understood.”

*We’ll give her what she needs, the voice said. Soft. Private. But not everything.*

Riis stood. “Keep moving forward. I'll e-mail you if I think of anything else. Until next time- don’t get tangled in trying to prove something invisible. Let the logic guide the vision, not the other way around.” She put her hand out to shake.

Lottie stood and took it. “Of course. Thank you, Dr. Riis.”

As she walked out into the hall, she felt lifted with validation. 


On the way home, she stopped at an office supply store. The space was over-warm and flooded with fluorescent light, the air tinged with the faint buzz of cheap fixtures. She moved through the aisles with quiet certainty.

She chose nine cork tiles, each twelve inches square. White pins. String in red, blue, and black. When she stepped back out onto the street, she felt steady. She had selected everything It would need.


It was early afternoon by time she returned to the brownstone. She set the office supply bag on the table, slipped off her shoes, and made her way to the kitchen with steady intent. She wasn’t hungry, but she knew she needed to eat. She didn’t want to interrupt her focus once she began.

She sliced thin rounds of apple, layered them with ham and Swiss between two slices of toasted bread, and added just a little Dijon. The heat softened the cheese; the apple kept its crunch. She ate standing up, leaning against the counter, methodical and silent. When she was done, she rinsed her plate and wiped down the cutting board.

Then she crossed to the office.

The far wall was still hung with a framed painting and an old brass clock, a gift from her father, or maybe from his secretary. She stared at them for a moment, then reached up and took them both down. She stacked them neatly in the closet. The wall looked cleaner without them. More available.

She brought the tiles in from the table and arranged them on the floor first — three by three, edges touching. A full square yard. No gaps.

She took her time mounting them to the wall. Tape first to mark the perimeter. Then adhesive strips to hold the weight. She pressed each tile firmly, smoothing her palm over the cork like as she set it into place.

When the last one was up, she stood in front of the wall, arms loose at her sides, eyes tracking the grid she’d built.

Nine perfect squares. Aligned. Blank. Waiting.

The house was silent. Outside, the muffled pulse of traffic pressed against the windows, but in the office, the quiet felt sealed-in. Like the room was holding its breath.

Lottie didn’t move right away. She let the stillness settle around her, watching the way the afternoon light traced across the wall, how it broke at the seams between tiles and came back together. She could feel the rhythm of her own pulse in her fingertips.

There was no voice. Not yet.

But she knew it would come.

She was preparing the space. Making room.

She turned, stepped carefully toward the table, and began to gather what she would need.

From her notebook, she copied down the core structure of the thesis: five major sections, each with their own sub-points, names, and references. She wrote neatly on large index cards and pinned them to the board in a cross formation, mapping the spine of the argument.

Eliade anchored the top point: origin, sacred center. Durkheim to the left, framed in parentheses, positioned as useful but resistant. Turner held the right flank, ritual and process. Mary Douglas settled at the bottom, her schema of purity and boundaries supporting everything above. And at the center of the star: a card that read only sacred belief systems as unifying architecture.

She stood back and adjusted each point until the symmetry felt correct. Then she began to fill the spaces between.

Sticky notes came next. Yellow squares pressed around each index card with annotations, marginalia, reminders: group thresholds, liminal rupture, psychotic as prophet. She added names of rites, movements, and figures referenced in the literature: Eleusinian mysteries, Shakers, Millerites, charismatic Pentecostals, women in ecstatic states.

One note near the center read simply: It as metonym. She didn’t remember writing it. She left it there.

She reached into the bag again and pulled out the black string.

Black for what was proven, traceable, footnoted. She connected Turner to Douglas, Douglas to Durkheim, and ran a taut line from Eliade to the idea of axis mundi, marked in pencil. She looped one strand around three case studies from the 20th century and pinned it down hard.

Then came the blue.

These were connections not yet drawn in literature but visible to her. Turner’s rites intersected with a personal theory on suffering as purification. A minor anthropological footnote about self-starvation among cloistered nuns ran a thread to Mary Douglas’s notes on contamination. She added a blue line between Heirophanies and the phrase sacred pressure, pinned like a pulse at the center of the map.

The red she saved for last.

She held it in her hand, feeling the subtle weight of it. Her chest rose. The hum was still quiet, but there — deeper now, less a sound than an ache.

She used red three times:

- A diagonal from axis mundi to It.

- A short, tight loop linking the phrase collapse is invitation to a sticky note that read gift.

- And one line — long, singular — from the upper left corner of the board to the lower right, slicing across everything else, pinned with tension.

It revealed through arrangement.

She stepped back.

The shape on the wall wasn’t random. It wasn’t even hers anymore. It had taken form through her, through her choices, her vision. It was outside her now. Breathing. Alive.

Lottie stood still for a long time, eyes flicking between the lines. Her chest rose and fell, quiet. Then she tilted her head.

“I made this for you.” she said aloud.

The silence hung, stretched. Then:

*You did well.*

She blinked with awareness. It came through her, from just beneath thought. Familiar.

She looked again at the red string. The center point. *It reveals through arrangement.*

“You showed me this. I wouldn’t have seen it otherwise.”

*You saw what was already there.* Then, You brought it into shape.

She stepped closer. Her fingers hovered near a pin.

“Then what do you want me to do with it?” she asked. “It can’t just be for me.”

*No.* A soft hum. *She’ll see too.*

Lottie’s hand dropped to her side. “Natalie.”

*She has seen before. She needs to look again.*

Lottie stared at the wall. The red line cutting through the black.

“She’s not ready.” 

*She will be.*

“No. She...” Lottie hesitated. Her pulse was louder in her ears now. “She’s not like me.”

*No. She’s not. But she’s yours.* A chill passed across the back of her neck. *And I like her.*

Lottie’s jaw clenched. She took another step back. “You don’t get to like her.”

*I already do.*

A beat. Her brought her hands to her face.

"This isn’t about her."

*Everything is about her*.

Lottie turned away from the board, suddenly cold.

“You can’t have her.”

The voice was quiet for a moment.

Then: *You brought her into you. Into our space.*

“I didn’t.”

*You did. You held her mind inside your own.*

Lottie closed her eyes. Her breath was shallow and quick.

“She’s mine.”

A pause.

Then:

*Too late.*

Lottie stood frozen in the middle of the room, the final echo of *Too late* echoing through her. Her jaw stayed clenched. Her eyes stayed closed. She didn’t argue again. She walked back to the wall.

The shape drew her in again. The red string slack at one angle, one pin slipped slightly from the cork. She pressed it back in with her thumb. She drew in a breath. *In with the good.* She exhaled. *Out with the bad* “Not Natalie. Not right now.”

The hum receded slightly — not gone, but quieter. Watching. Waiting.

Lottie reached for her notebook again and flipped to a blank page. The wall was the guide. She would follow the shape. She would trace It from pattern to logic to language. The deeper truth was here. She could feel it, its gravity pulling at the corners of her vision. She didn’t need to fight the voice. Not if she understood It fully.

She sat cross-legged on the floor, notebook open, pen steady in hand. Her eyes flicked between the lines on the cork board and the blankness before her. The structure was already before her. She only needed to translate it.


Lottie lost track of time. The sun was long gone. The apartment had cooled. The room was lit in the warm light of a floor lamp. She sat cross-legged on the floor, notebook balanced on her knee, her pen hovering above the page. The cork wall loomed in front of her, threaded with lines that seemed to pulse when she blinked too long. S

he was trying to hold the shape in words. She’d hand-written three pages in formal, academic, and clear language, but she was finding it incresingly difficult to organize her thoughts has her mind became fatigued. 

She muttered as she worked, testing phrasing aloud. “The ritual framework is not the symbol itself. It’s the pattern... no, it’s the... structure. The structure around the symbol, the scaffolding that lets the It take hold...”

*Language is a veil.* She paused. Adjusted a line.

“It needs order. If it doesn’t have order, it’s just... vision. That’s not enough.”

*Order is not truth. Order is comfort.*

The wall didn’t answer, but something inside her shifted — a pressure behind the eyes, a prickle at the back of her neck. She pressed her palm flat to the notebook. Steady.

“I’m not writing scripture. I’m writing a thesis.”

*Call it what you like.*

There was a beat of silence. Then another shift... like warmth moving under her skin.

“I can’t give you everything. You know that.”

*You already have.*

The hum returned, the edge of something vast brushing against the inner walls of her skull. She sat still, notebook open beside her, pen forgotten on the floor. Her hands rested in her lap.

Behind her, the subtle creak of floorboards, the opening of a door, the ghost of footsteps.

She felt something had changed in the room but Lottie didn’t turn around. She kept her eyes on the shape she’d made, and her focus on the voice inside her mind.


“Lottie?”

Lottie’s head turned slightly, just enough to register her standing there in the doorway, backlit by the hallway light, still in her clothes from studio, her brow furrowed, eyes wide.

Natalie stepped forward. “I’ve been calling you.”

Lottie blinked. She hadn’t heard.

Natalie’s gaze swept over the room. Her eyes caught on the wall, then on the notebook lying open beside Lottie’s knee. “You were...” Natalie stopped herself. Her voice softened, but the worry sharpened. “You were talking to someone.”

Lottie didn’t answer right away. She shifted, placing a hand over the notebook like it needed covering. 

Natalie took another step. “Lottie. Are you okay?” The question hung there. Too simple for what she meant.

Lottie met her eyes. “I’m fine.” She spoke too quickly. Too flat.

Natalie held her gaze without blinking. “You don’t sound fine.”

Lottie tried to smile, but it didn’t land. Her chest still felt too open, her mind still too close to the edges.

“I’m working. That’s all. I just... got deep into it.”

Natalie glanced back at the wall again. “Yeah. I can see that.”

Lottie’s voice came softer now, almost measured. “You don’t have to be afraid. It’s just… theory.”

But even as she said it, she knew it wasn’t true. Not anymore. She took a breath.

“Come to bed.”

Lottie didn’t move.

The hum flickered.

Natalie held her gaze. “Please.”

A long pause.

Then, finally, Lottie closed the notebook. Set it gently on the floor. The cork wall remained, pulsing silently behind her.

“I’m coming.” Her voice trembled just slightly.

They moved upstairs together in silence.

The light in the hallway was low, golden and soft. Lottie didn’t reach for it. She moved by memory, letting the shadows guide her up the stairs, Natalie just behind her. She could feel the pull of her, stedy and anchoring, and it ached in her chest.

In the bathroom, they undressed without speaking. Lottie kept her eyes low, folded her clothes with precision. Natalie’s touch brushed her arm once, warm and wordless. Lottie didn’t pull away, but she didn’t look up either.

They stepped into the shower. Natalie washed first, then passed the soap to Lottie and let her have space.

Lottie moved through the motions with care. Rinsing her face, combing her fingers through her hair, scrubbing gently at the insides of her wrists. She watched the water swirl down the drain instead of meeting Natalie’s gaze. Her eyes stayed low, her body language small. Contained.

Afterward, in the bedroom, Natalie pulled on a t-shirt and sat on the edge of the bed. She watched Lottie move as she toweled off, pulled on clean underwear and one of her loose cotton nightshirts.

It was when Lottie turned to cross to the bed that Natalie finally spoke.

“Why won’t you look at me?” she asked, voice soft, not accusatory. “What’s wrong?”

Lottie froze, mid-step. Her eyes stayed on the floor. Inside, the pressure stirred.

*Look at her.* Lottie’s breath hitched. *Bring her back in. Let her see.* She shook her head, barely. *You need her. So do we.*

“No.” Lottie whispered.

Natalie blinked. “No?” Her voice rose slightly in confusion. “Why not?”

Lottie’s jaw trembled. She couldn’t explain it, not in a way that made sense. Not without inviting It closer. Not without the risk of opening the door again. She didn’t want to expose Natalie. If she looked at her now, she was afraid the tether would join them again and that the voice would follow it straight into her.

Lottie took another step, eyes still down. “I just… need a minute.”

Natalie didn’t push. But she didn’t stop watching. Lottie climbed into bed without meeting her gaze. The silence stretched between them, heavy with things unsaid.
