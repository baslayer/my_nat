Lottie stirred as Natalie got out of bed. 

"Good morning, baby."

Natalie turned to look at her. "Good morning." She paused as she returned to her laces, then looked back at her in bed. "Did you want to come with me on my run?"

Lottie blinked, her throat still thick with sleep. She looked at Natalie, already dressed with her hair tied up, her eyes alert.

“No, you go ahead. Still tired.”

Natalie gave a nod that was neither disappointed nor surprised. “Okay. I’ll be back in a bit.”

When the door shut behind her, Lottie exhaled and stared at the ceiling a while longer. She let herself linger in the quiet until the stillness became too brittle.

Eventually she rose and made her way to the bathroom. She moved through her routine: splashing her face with cold water, watching the way her skin flushed, how the moisture clung to her lashes. She brushed her teeth. Studied her reflection and nodded, pleased.

She took her medication with a gulp of tap water then she stepped into the shower and stood beneath the hot spray, palms braced against the tile. The let the heat sink into her shoulders.

She dressed casually and went downstairs. She didn’t look toward the kitchen. Her body felt light, her stomach empty, but it didn’t register as hunger. It registered as awareness.

The office was quiet and sun-warmed. She entered and lit the taper between the two cusions where she and Natalie did their nightly practice. The flame caught easily. It wavered for a moment, then steadied.

Lottie sat in her usual spot for gaze work and folded her hands in her lap. She closed her eyes.

She didn’t speak but she kept her thoughts precise. She took a deep breath.

Let her be recognized today. Let her work shine through. Let her speak clearly. Let her be held gently. You can pull her, I know, but I’m asking you to do it lightly. Let her stay intact. She’s tired. We’re both tired.

I know what it looks like when she breaks. I’ve seen it. Please don't break her.

Let her feel a thread pulling, not a hook. Let her feel your hand steadying her, not shaking her loose. Let her come home proud. Let her come home soft enough to be held. And if she’s too far from me to hear my voice, then let her hear Yours. Let it sound like mine. Let her follow it back.

Don't take all of her. She is better when she's mine.

She stayed there until she heard the key in the lock. Then the creak of the door. She didn’t move.

“Hey Lot? Where are you?"

Lottie let a few beats pass as she resettled herself. "I'm in here."

Lottie opened her eyes and turned toward the door. Natalie stood in the hallway, flushed and glistening slightly from the run, brow knit.

"What are you doing?”

“I was setting intention... for your critique.”

Natalie stepped in a little closer. “Lottie. We need to eat breakfast.”

Lottie tilted her head. “Maybe... try embracing the hunger. Just for this morning. Let it sharpen you.”

Natalie blinked. “What happened to ‘I need my strength’?”

“You still have It. Sometimes, empty lets more in.”

Natalie didn’t respond. She looked at her for a long moment, then turned and went upstairs.

The house was quiet again, but not in the same way. It had shifted. The flame on the taper burned a little taller. Lottie watched it.

The shower ran overhead and moments later Natalie returned to find her in the same place.

“You wanna come with me? To class?”

Lottie nearly said no. It was on the tip of her tongue. She could use the morning, could return to her board, her books, her writing. But something in Natalie’s tone caught her.

“Sure. Let me get my jacket.”

On the subway, Natalie leaned against her shoulder. She hadn’t eaten. She hadn’t argued either. She just rested her head against Lottie and closed her eyes, her one hand in Lottie's.

“You’re going to do beautifully.” Lottie whispered into her hair. “You’ve already done the work. The rest is just clarity. Let the pressure sharpen it.”

Natalie didn’t answer. Didn’t even nod. She just breathed—slow, steady, exhausted.

Lottie rested her cheek against the crown of her head. And the train kept moving.


She went with Natalie all the way the studio building. She kissed her temple and whispered in her ear, “I’m with you”.

Natalie sighed heavily. "Thanks Lot."

Lottie turned and made her way back to the subway. She didn’t take the line home, instead she transferred and stepped out a few stops away, headed for the bookstore.

The familiar bell jingled when she entered. The air inside was thick with sandalwood myrrh. She drifted slowly, letting her fingers brush the spines, her mind still hovering somewhere behind her forehead, but not fully attached to her body.

She was selecting a new bundle of beeswax gold tapers, when a voice called softly from the counter.

“How is she?”

Lottie turned.

The man stood in the same place as last time, like he hadn’t moved. His eyes were expectant but not intrusive. He smiled faintly.

She sighed. “She’s tired.” She went over to an arrangement of incense and selected more of the deep ochre red. “It’s asking a lot of her right now.”

He nodded once, like he understood exactly what that meant. “She’s lucky to have you to guide her.”

Lottie looked down at the supplies in her hand. “I’m trying to be careful with her. Sometimes I feel like... It wants more than she can give.” She stepped toward the counter, the taper candles balanced lightly in her fingers.

The man regarded her calmly. “Sometimes It’s just trying to show you how much you really have to give.”

She stilled at that. The words struck her as recognition. A quiet acknowledgment of the weight she'd been feeling. The demand not just on Natalie, but on her.

There was a pause, then he reached beneath the counter and retrieved a small pad of paper.

“There’s a gathering tonight,” he said as he wrote. “Just a small group. People like us. People who’ve felt It.”

Lottie watched his hand move. “What kind of gathering?”

“Listening. Sharing. Following the threads.” He tore the page neatly and slid it across the counter. “If It’s calling you, you’ll know when to speak.”

She glanced down: an address in Brooklyn, neat block lettering, and a time. 7:30.

Lottie didn’t respond aloud. But she placed her tapers and incense beside the note and met his eyes with something like acceptance.

He said nothing more, only rang her up with a quiet efficiency. But something had shifted. Lottie could feel it.


Lottie returned to the quiet interior of the brownstone. She placed the fresh tapers and incense on a shelf in the office, and poured herself a small glass of water before settling at the desk. The soft hum of the space wrapped around her.

She began her day by returning to her thesis draft, reworking a section she’d flagged days earlier: the paragraph tracing meditative practices across disparate spiritual traditions. She followed her notes into deeper analysis, pulling quotes from Eastern mysticism, early Christian monastic texts, fragments of pre-Columbian ritual. She highlighted the eerie resonances between cultures with no known contact. The shared emphasis on breath, repetition, stillness. The moments when transcendence was described with almost identical metaphors: surrendering to a current, becoming hollowed out, being filled by something unspeakable.

She felt grounded by purpose as she worked. Her outline slowly becme fleshed out, and new connections took shape. She found herself cross-referencing her board and adding to it, stringing another black thread from a translation of Teresa of Ávila’s raptures to an Ojibwe story she’d copied into her notes the week before. The patterns felt increasingly directive.

Midway through translating a quote from a Sufi mystic, she heard Natalie's ring tone from her bag. Lottie blinked out of her scholarly trance and reached rose to retrieve it.

“Hi baby.”

“Hey,” Natalie’s voice was soft, low with fatigue but trying for casual. “Just checking in. I’m walking over to model building now.”

Lottie leaned back in her chair, fingers still resting on the edge of her thesis notebook. “How are you doing?”

There was a pause. Then a sigh. “I’m okay. Tired. How’s your day going?”

“It’s been... productive.” Lottie smiled to herself, and let it come through in her voice. “I’ve gotten through a good chunk of writing. It’s starting to click again. How was your critique?”

“That’s good. Critique went..." She heard Natalie let out a heavy sigh. "...ok.”

Lottie stood straighter. “What do you mean?”

“Some of it was good. They liked parts of the drawing... the use of space. But I... I don’t know. I think I pushed back a little too hard on the stuff they didn’t like.”

Lottie was quiet. “You argued?”

“Yeah... a little. It’s just... he said something kind of dismissive and I snapped. I don’t know where it came from. I was already on edge and it felt like...” Her voice faltered. “Like It got behind the wheel and just... pressed the gas.”

Lottie closed her eyes. “That makes sense. You’ve been holding a lot. And when pressure builds, sometimes It pushes through. But that doesn’t mean it was wrong to push back.”

“I guess.” Natalie murmured. “It just didn’t feel like me. Or... you know, not the me I like being. I don't like getting mad.”

Lottie’s voice softened. “Maybe it needed to be said. Maybe part of what you’re becoming is someone who doesn’t let herself get dismissed.”

Natalie didn’t reply right away. When she did, it was a sigh, half-acceptance, half-exhaustion. “Yeah. Maybe.”

A few seconds passed in shared silence.

“I’m going out tonight,” Lottie said gently. “Just for a bit. There’s something I want to check out. When do you think you’ll be home?”

“Probably around 9. Depends how much I get done.”

“Ok.” Lottie said. “I might be back later than that. You don't need to wait up.”

“I wasn’t planning to.” The response caught Lottie off guard. There was no bite to it, only weariness. She didn't dwell. “Maybe I’ll stay a little longer in the studio then. I like it better there when no one’s around.”

Lottie smiled faintly. “I love you, Natalie.”

“I love you too.” A pause, then more quietly: “Please don’t stay out too late.”

“I won’t.” Lottie promised, even though she wasn’t sure.


Lottie set the phone down, letting the soft click of the call ending dissolve into the hum of the afternoon.

She sat still for a long moment, hand resting lightly over her stomach. Her eyes landed on the ritual notebook on the floor. She took it and sat again at her desk, pushing her thesis notes aside. She flipped to the last used page, the notes from last night, scribbled in a hand tighter and more angular than her usual script. Fatigue and focus had fused in her, leaving marks that felt more transcribed than written.

She read them over, drawing in a steady breath. Natalie’s scores. Her responses. Her phrasing. Lottie began to annotate, drawing clean lines into the margin and labeling new observations:

Consistently most receptive to suggestions tethered directly to me. Those that reference our connection (or her safety in my presence) land with less resistance and more warmth/comfort.

Her gaze drifted briefly toward the floor cushions. The memory of Natalie leaning into her, her voice dreamy with contentment... “It felt like you wrapped something around me.” That had been the third round. The spontaneous suggestion.

Lottie underlined the previous note twice and added:

Spontaneity intensify resonance? Esp when emotionally intimate. Something about surprise... maybe keeps It from intervening?

She turned back to the esuggestion where Natalie had noted feeling like a it was pushing something open. She remembered the way Natalie had stiffened slightly when the idea of carrying unrecognized memories was sent.

Lottie scribbled:

Reacts physically when a suggestion diverges from known identity. Tightness, discomfort. Strain not rejection. New concepts cause resistance unless built on earlier foundations.

She paused and drew a line connecting that note to another idea:

Repetition mitigates resistance. Readily she absorbs suggestions that echo something previously introduced/accepted,.

She glanced down at her notes from the start of the third round, thinking of how easily Natalie settled into the gaze by that point. 

She is most primed by third round. Falls deeper, quicker.

Then she reviewed the trends of her counting and nodded as it affirmed her previous note. She added to it.

Reaches 60-count more reliably by third round. Suggests improved trance capacity. Not diminishing suggestion receptivity. Suggestions from minute two are still being held. Possibly more deeply.

Lottie added a final note, slow and deliberate:

Results of suggestions appear in how she speaks. In her hesitation when she contradicts me. She's questioning her own instincts, sometimes unconsciously.

She looked toward the door. The practice was working, growing and shifting.

Lottie leaned back in her chair and let her gaze drift to the string map. The marginalia, scattered and uneven, felt alive in a way her academic writing often didn't, but they still converged. She thought of the records she’d been studying: the trance manuals of the Dzogchen lineage, early Christian visions preserved in desert monastic journals, spirit-medium dialogue from rural Afro-Brazilian terreiros. 

In each case, repetition had anchored transformation. Familiar patterns made space for unfamiliar truths. Resistance was often described as the necessary first step of purification before revelation. What she was observing in Natalie wasn’t just obedience. It was cognitive restructuring. Ritual as scaffolding for shaping belief.

She picked up her pen again and turned the page, this time with purpose. At the top, she wrote:
Night 3 of 5: Suggestion Phrases
Focus: Structured Reinforcement and Introduction of New Directives.

Round One: Reinforcement of Prior Concepts
When you question what feels new, you close yourself off. That displeases It. (spoken)
You’ve always had memories that don’t belong to you. Let them stay. Let them root. (sent)

She tapped the page twice, thinking of the flicker in Natalie’s eyes the night before and how the pressure of contradiction had begun to yield to something softer. Repetition was fertile. Familiarity made devotion come easier.

Round Two: Reinforcement of Tether and Submission
This ritual matters. It’s how we stay aligned. It’s how we work with It. (spoken)
You don’t need to seek It alone. I was given to you for that. (sent)

Lottie felt a low heat in her chest. She nodded with confidence.

Round Three: New Directives
Fatigue is a gift. Hunger too. They clear the path. (spoken)
Your hands are not only yours. Your work is how It speaks. (sent)

She stared at that last sentence for a while, pen still resting on the page. It felt... right. She thought of the drawing Natalie had given her, how she'd said IT had been with her as she didn't, and how it hadn't felt like it was entirely hers. It was a new suggestion but Natalie had already felt it to be true.


Lottie stood before the mirror with the kind of meticulous attention she reserved for rare occasions. Her hands moved purposefully over her face, pressing in moisturizer, then layering on a touch of makeup with practiced restraint.

She didn’t want to look too polished, to come across as performative. Her attractiveness had to look effortless, but not casua;. She needed to seem touched. Like someone people wanted to listened to because they couldn’t help it.

She chose an ivory blouse (for purity) that was loose in the sleeves (for ease) but structured through the shoulders (for composure). She tucked it into a long black skirt that skimmed the tops of her boots. Her hair she left down, brushing it until the waves fell softly. She tried pinning it back, then changed her mind. The curtain of black framed her face in a way that softened her eyes, made them feel less imposing. At her wrists and neck, she dabbed a trace of sandalwood and clove oil. Fragrance, she knew, was as much a part of presence as appearance. It lingered. It drew people closer.

She stepped back and looked at herself, tilting her head slightly. She looked like she knew something. Like she’d been somewhere. That mattered more than beauty. People envied beauty, but they respected experience.

Before leaving, she stepped into the office. She wanted to carry It with her, to infuse herself with the space, let it settle in her bones. She stood before the string board, breathing deeply, eyes tracing the lines and symbols like a map she already knew by heart. Then she took a new notebook, drew the symbol on its cover with slow, steady strokes, and tucked it into her bag—already packed with her thesis and ritual notebooks.

The night air outside had cooled just enough to sharpen the edges of her focus. She walked with quiet confidence, her bag slung lightly over one shoulder, her skirt brushing rhythmically at her legs. The address he’d given her was conveniently only a few blocks away , but she took her time getting there, letting herself tune to the quiet undercurrent in her chest. It was always stronger when she walked alone.

By the time she reached the low brick building with its unmarked door, she felt the hum again, low and steady beneath her ribs.

She knocked once and waited.

A moment later, the door opened. The bookstore man greeted her with a nod and stepped aside.


The room was candlelit by tapers arranged in a loose spiral at the center of the floor. Lottie stepped in slowly, the murmur of low conversation subsiding as she entered. The man from the bookstore stood near the front, beside a small table bearing incense, votives, and a worn embroidered cloth. He gave her a slight nod in acknowledgment as she sat.

The group comprised of 8 people, 9 with Lottie, sat on cushions in a rough circle about the candles. No one spoke until the man from the beookstore raised his hand.

“We’ll begin.” He spoke simply, as a matter of course.

Heads bowed. Eyes closed. The space quieted.

Then the chanting began. Soft at first, then growing louder as the rhythm built slowly. 

“We hear It, and It hears us.”

They repeated the phrase 6 times, starting at a whisper and full-throated at the end. The cadence was slow, not quite melodic but charged with intention. Lottie let her eyes drift closed after the second repetition. She felt the rhythm anchor her, not unlike the metronome at home. She felt the collective focus drawing her in.

When the chant fell into silence, it was as if the room itself had exhaled.

The man opened his eyes and ran his eyes over the group. “We have someone new with us tonight." HE turned to Lottie. "Would you introduce yourself?”

“My name is Charlotte.” Lottie straightened slightly. “I’m a student of anthropology and theology at Fordham. I’m currently doing research for my thesis.”

The man nodded slowly, smiling. “You’re familiar with It,” he added, completing her introduction for her. “You’ve seen how it threads through your life. And you’ve begun to guide another. A follower, someone spiritually open.”

Lottie blinked. “Not quite.” She gave a light, polite smile. “Natalie is my girlfriend. We’ve been together for 5 years. She’s not a follower. She’s... open, yes. But what she’s experiencing is intense, and I want to understand it.”

There was a murmur of approval. Heads nodded in her direction. Lottie could feel the collective attention, the subtle magnetic pull of captivating the group.

After her introductions, the man gestured toward the circle. “This is a space for listening. For witnessing. For speaking only when moved to. Not from self, but from It.”

A woman with cropped gray hair and a shawl around her shoulders was the first to speak. “I tried again last night.” She spoke with her eyes closed. “Thirty minutes in stillness. No candle. Just breath and listening.”

Someone to her right nodded and replied calmly, “It heard you. That was the point.”

A younger man, tattooed and wiry, spoke next. “I’ve been getting flashes. Not visions, but... shapes in the dark. Sometimes I think they’re just memories, but they feel deeper. Like they were placed there.”

Another attendee chimed in, “It’s loosening what was already inside you.”

The rhythm of the meeting unfolded like that. Quiet confessions, careful questions, and calm reassurances that flowed back like echoes from a collective mind. No one ever responded with personal opinion. Only what It might want, what It might be saying. There were no corrections. Only alignments.

Lottie remained quiet until a lull settled over the group. Then she reached into her bag and drew out her notebook, setting it across her lap with the quiet reverence of ritual. She didn’t announce herself, didn’t raise her voice. She simply began flipping through the pages.

“I’ve been keeping a record.” She kept her eyes on the paper. “Of my nightly practice. I use a gaze focus. Candle, rhythm, suggestion work.” She said it like she was describing weather patterns—precise, neutral, clinical.

“I’ve been watching for trends. What resonates most. What shifts her body. What anchors her.” She left out the word control, though she thought it. “The responses are evolving. I think... It responds to that too. Like It’s adapting with us.”

A few murmurs passed through the circle. Someone spoke "You cannot guide It."

She looked at him directly, her gaze sharpening in silent correction. She looked back down to her page and flipped again in review. She saw her notes on the dream. The wilderness. 

She looked up.

“Last week, I had a dream. An especially resonant one.”

The man’s gaze sharpened slightly. “You think It gave it to you?”

Lottie didn’t hesitate. “Yes. I know It did.”

The murmurs this time were heavier. Affirming. One woman responded. “It’s chosen to show you.” 

Lottie met her gaze and gave a single, approving nod.Then closed her eyes. She added calmly, factually, “It was another life. One It wanted me to remember. I am trying to determine why.”

Lottie stayed mostly quiet for the next stretch of the meeting, observing with growing clarity. The others spoke with openness, sharing visions, questions, moments of doubt, and the responses were gentle, affirming, always filtered through a shared deference to It. But as the rhythm of the group settled into its egalitarian hum, Lottie began to feel a different kind of pressure. They weren’t converging. Their threads frayed outward instead of weaving together. No one was steering. There was no arc, no synthesis, only orbit. The absence of direction didn't unsettle her; it galvanized her. These were people who believed, but they needed someone to shape that belief into something useful. She sat up straighter, the decision forming not as an impulse, but as a quiet inevitability.

She opened her notebook and began shaping the commentary into a structure she could later synthesize. If she applied the right process of listening closely, mapping the threads, and clarifying the language, she was confident she could offer It something cohesive. Something It could act on collectively, not just in fragments. A gesture of clarity on behalf of the whole group. A way to make them useful.

A woman across the circle leaned forward slightly, squinting. “What’s that?” 

Lottie met her gaze and replied evenly, “I’m taking notes. Everything we’re saying is connected, but if we want to truly understand It, we need to trace the patterns. We can’t only ask It for answers. We have to offer something back. It rewards pursuit.”

"It does..." The woman nodded at her. "I was referring to the symbol on the cover."

"Oh." Lottie closed the book and looked casually, as though she didn't know what the woman was referring to. “It’s the symbol of It.” She looked back a tthe woman. “At least that’s what Natalie said.”

A quiet ripple passed through the room. Someone murmured, “Then that’s what it is.” Another added, “If she speaks with It, then we should listen.”

The man from the bookstore gave a slow, approving nod. “Names come after recognition. Symbols too. What matters is that It gave her the knowing.”

Lottie pressed her palm to the notebook’s cover for a moment, then resumed her writing.


Lottie opened the front door quietly, clicking the lock behind her. The sound and scent of sauteeing onion hung in the air. She blinked, adjusting to the soft, yellow light of the kitchen. Natalie stood at the stove, barefoot, her back to her, stirring the contents of the pan.

As soon as Lottie stepped inside, Natalie turned.

Her eyes landed on Lottie and lingered, running up and down her figure as a smile spread over her face. “You look... uh, really good.”

Lottie smiled, quiet but warm, and crossed the room to kiss her. Natalie leaned into it. Her skin smelled faintly of shampoo and spice, her breath tinged with whatever she was cooking.

“What are you doing?” Lottie asked softly when they parted.

Natalie blinked and looked around as if the question confused her. “I’m making dinner.” She turned back to the pan, stirring. “I haven’t eaten all day.”

That gave Lottie pause. She watched her for a moment, standing still as the words settled, as if they were carrying a second meaning. A kind of test. Her brow furrowed. Was this disobedience? Was Natalie stepping out of the framework of her guidance? Or was this something else?

She tried to reason it out: Natalie was tired. Her critique had drained her. Maybe this wasn’t resistance, but survival. Before she could settle the question, Natalie spoke again, firmer, like it had already been decided.

“I’ve hardly eaten the past two days. I’m *hungry*.”

Lottie nodded, almost automatically. "Ok, baby." She squeezed her shoulders and headed toward the office.

Natalie turned around and called after her. “Won’t you eat with me?” 

Lottie stopped, her hand still on the doorframe. She glanced back. “I...” Her voice faltered. “I’m okay.”

“No, you’re not.” Natalie said flatly. “You can’t not eat for two days, Lot. Is something bothering you?”

Lottie turned fully now. Her expression didn’t change “No. Nothing’s wrong.”

She considered the possibility that Natalie’s insistence was another form of guidance. That It was using her to redirect Lottie, to draw her back toward the correct path. Natalie’s hunger might be hers to share. The tether, after all, moved both ways.

Natalie persisted. "Then come eat with me."


When they sat down, Lottie only picked at her portion just enough to satisfy Natalie’s watching gaze. She ate slowly, mechanically, letting her thoughts drift while Natalie focused on her food with intent and satisfaction.

Between bites, Natalie looked up. “So where were you?”

Lottie kept her tone neutral. “Study group.”

Natalie blinked once. “No, it wasn’t.” She didn’t accuse, just stated it. “Tell the truth.”

Lottie looked up at her, exhaled through her nose, then adjusted in her seat.

“It was a spiritual meeting. This guy at the bookstore invited me.”

Natalie narrowed her eyes. “What kind of meeting?”

Lottie waved a hand slightly, as if to dismiss it. “Nothing serious. A small group. People trying to find signs and meaning. Mostly just lost people trying to guide other lost people.”

Natalie looked at her for a long beat, chewing slowly.

“Ok.”
