Van sat illuminated by a fire before a circle of girls seated on the floor. The girls from their old team. Lottie recognized their shapes before their names: the slope of Mari’s shoulders, the way Akilah hugged her knees. Van’s voice was low and steady. Everyone was eating furtively, a palpable heaviness hung over the group.

“Once upon a time, there was a place called the wilderness. It was beautiful and full of life, but it was also lonely and violent and misunderstood. So, one day, the wilderness built a house. It waited." Lottie watched Van ran her eyes over the group. "Summers came... Winters came...”

Lottie’s breath caught. And then she was speaking.

“I never wanted to be in charge.” Her voice was soft, but the room held still around it. She felt the captivated stares. “It chose me, I think, because... because I was the only one who knew how to listen. But I can’t hear it anymore. I think that’s because it doesn’t need me anymore.”

The fire crackled. Someone shifted. “You all learned how to hear it.” She stood slowly. “The wilderness chose who fed us. It’s already chosen who should lead us.” She walked to Natalie.

Natalie’s hair was longer, faded peroxide blonde with dark roots at her scalp. Her face was worn from exhaustion, and her expression bore a profound sense of guilt that Lottie had never seen in her bfore. Her mouth was pressed into a hard line, her eyes were wet. She didn’t move when Lottie dropped to her knees in front of her.

Lottie reached up and kissed her hand. One by one, the others followed. They bowed in displays of admiration and subjugation in succession in a process that felt like a coronation.

Then Natalie was shaking her. “Oh my God. Fire! Fire! Get up! Get up!”

The room broke into a panic with shouts rising and bodies scrambling. Smoke coiled in the air like a living thing.

“Fuck! It’s stuck!” Natalie yanked at the door as Van and Tai rushed to her side. Together, they broke it open.

“Go! Go!” Natalie shouted. “Get your stuff! Get anything you can!”

Tai grabbed her by the arm. “Come on, Natalie! Come on, go, go!”

“I’m right behind you!” Natalie shouted, pushing them through the smoke.

Then the cold. Biting, intense. Lottie stood alone, the cabin engulfed in front of her. Flames clawed through the roof and billowed from the windows. The heat licked her face, hot enough to sting. Her skin burned. But she didn’t flinch. She only watched.

A digital beeping echoed through the trees, mechanical and repetitive. It reminded her of a fire alarm, or maybe something else. Something real.

Natalie’s voice echoed again. I’m right behind you.

She woke with a sharp inhale. The sensations were still alive in her body: the panic, the cold at her back, the heat across her face. But her eyes saw only the ceiling, striped with gentle blue light through the blinds. For a second, she didn’t know where she was.

The beeping.

She turned her head.

The alarm clock glowed red against the dresser: 7:00.

Lottie sat up slowly, heart still hammering, the realness of the dream clinging to her like smoke. She threw the blankets aside and stood barefoot. Her legs felt unsteady. Natalie’s side of the bed was empty. Already gone.

The details were already fraying. She moved quickly, the latent urgency of evacuation still coursing through her veins.

Down the stairs. Through the hall. Into the office.

She flipped on the light, grabbed a pen before even sitting, opened her ritual notebook to a blank page. She scrawled the words before they could vanish:

Cabin. Fire. The girls. Van in front of the hearth. Telling a story like a sermon.
“Once upon a time, there was a place called the wilderness…”
She said it waited. That the wilderness built a house. That it was lonely. Misunderstood.
Summers came. Winters came. 
Everyone listened. Eating, but hungry. 

I spoke. Didn't want to lead. Chosen because I listened.
Because no one else knew how. It didn’t need me anymore.
I said Natalie was the one now. And everyone believed me. 

Natalie: worn down, exhausted, eyes wet. She didn’t want it either. She didn’t fight it.
I knelt. I kissed her hand. The others followed. One by one. Like a coronation. Like worship.

Then smoke. Screaming. The door stuck. Tai and Van breaking it open.
Natalie yelling: “Get your stuff! Go!” She pushed everyone out before her.

Alone in the snow. Watching it burn. Feeling the heat on my face. 
Too real. Like a memory. 

She stared at the page, her breath shallow. Writing it down anchored it. The details stopped fading and began to take root, like memory. The air in the office felt colder than it should have. The metronome sat still on the desk, but she could almost hear it ticking—as if waiting for her to do something.

Her stomach cramped sharply. Hunger. For a moment, she mistook it for a phantom from the dream. But it was real. She’d barely eaten the day before, and now the hunger gripped her with focus.

“Shit.”

She checked the time again. 7:05. Still, she didn’t move. Her hand hovered over the notebook, poised to write more. But there was nothing else. The dream’s edges were sealed. She tried to peer beyond them, but failed. Only the heat on her face remained.

She took a breath, steadying herself. Upstairs, she washed quickly, then drifted to the kitchen. She opened the fridge and went for the leftover chicken. The craving was intense, meat, specifically. She ate a few bites straight from the container.

Then she stopped.

Not full. Not satisfied. But something told her to hold back. The hunger felt clarifying. Useful. As though staying hungry might keep her closer to the dream.

She left the brownstone just before 9. She wore her jacket open against the morning wind. The sky was bright, the sidewalks busy with dog-walkers, strollers, commuters. But the city felt far away, like she was moving behind glass. Its noise was muted, every person a blur of motion. She kept her pace brisk, letting the wind bite at her skin.

Stay in it.

She focused on the hollow in her stomach. The slight tremble in her hands. She didn’t want to lose the feeling. The dream had an edge she couldn't describe... the more she dwelled on it the more she felt she was identifying something that lived within her.

She road the subway and kept her gaze low. A man shouted at a panhandler. Tourists murmured over maps. It all felt miles away.

The wilderness.
It had waited. It had built a house.

She pictured Van’s expression, lit orange by firelight. Focused, still. Not telling a story, exactly, but an account... a myth. A sacred narrative.

Lottie blinked against the sun as she stepped out from the platform. The sidewalk turned slightly uphill.

Natalie.

She saw her again: seated, worn, her face slack with exhaustion and resignation. Her eyes wet, her expression unplaceable. Lottie knew her so well, but here, she was almost unrecognizable. The terror in her eyes. The quiet horror. Then deep sadness tinged with love. She hadn’t fought the coronation. She had even let out a laugh, almost in disbelief.

Lottie’s chest tightened. The image of Natalie didn’t fade and it brought her real pain. The more she thought of it, the sharper it became. She saw her from below, the way she looked as Lottie knelt before her. Her signture stillness. Like something inside her had been spent. Or devoured.

And the others. The way they looked at Lottie when she spoke. The way they bowed to Natalie after she had. The sequence. The obedience. The lack of hesitation.

They were believers.

Lottie didn’t remember making the turn onto Fordham’s campus, but suddenly the buildings rose around her. She blinked again. The stone walls felt colder than the city. The trees orange and red, drifting into dormancy with the onset of autumn. It was as if the wilderness had followed her there, had changed its shape and slipped in through the cracks.

She exhaled slowly and stepped through the door of her building. Ethnographic Methods was on the second floor. She didn’t want to lose the feeling. The dream. The world it came from.

She pressed a hand to her stomach and climbed the stairs.

Still hungry. Still listening.


The arrived to lecture moments before it began. Lottie slipped into the back of the classroom. Ethnographic Methods was a course she normally found grounding but it unfolded before her like radio static. Words on participant observation, field notes, and researcher positionality blurred as they hit her ears and dissipated just as quickly.

She opened her notebook and scrawled sparse notes, not caring if they were legible or organized. She stared at the lines of the apge, seeing firelight flicker between them. Her fingers twitched with the memory of smoke.

She thought of Van again. Natalie. The heat against her face. The hunger in her gut persisted.

When the class finally ended, she made it home without memory of the commute. She dropped her bag by the front door and moved straight to the office.

She sat and reread her notes from that morning, eyes moving over each line like a map she was trying to decode. Her breath slowed. She waited for something to click. 

"Are you there?"

Nothing.

She lit the incense and set it beside the notebook. Then she flicked the metronome to life. The steady ticks filled the quiet, anchoring her to something temporal.

"I know you're here."

Still nothing.

Lottie’s eyes roamed the space, restless, until they landed on the doorframe.

The symbol.

Her stomach dropped. It hit her all at once, hard. She strode to it, almost floating, and ran her finger over it. A vision of it carved into a tree overlaid the graphite on doorframe.

“This was already there. Before us.”

A breath. The incense curled smoke toward the ceiling.

And then, finally, the voice: You saw what was to be.

Lottie blinked, her hand still resting on the graphite lines.

“Was it real? The dream?”

A pause, then: It is a place in time.

Lottie’s breath caught. She looked down at the symbol, suddenly aware of how deep it ran through her. Not a dream. Not just a vision.

She turned slightly, her voice almost pleading now. “Then what is this? The symbol. What does it mean?”

The incense burned richer now, crimson smoke rising in a slow spiral. The voice wrapped around it, curling in the air: It is the mark of the wilderness. It waits for those who listen.

Lottie felt a chill climb the back of her neck.

“We remembered it.”

The metronome ticked. Her heart beat in time.

“Where was that place?” Her heart raced. “Where were we?”

You were with me. Where you should have been.

She moved back a step, breath shallow. “When was it?”

When you were needed.

She became frutrated to the point of fear. “What does tht mean?”

There was no answer.

She thought the room grew darker somehow. The incense became exhausted and the smoke ceased. Lottie looked around the office at the board and her notes and felt disoriented. Like she was displaced.

“Natalie was there. I felt her.”

She is always with you.

Lottie stepped away from the symbol, her hand falling to her side.

She didn’t fully understand but she felt the weight of it. Something had shifted. The dream was not just a dream. The symbol was not a coincidence. It was telling her something real.

Lottie moved to the desk in a daze. Her fingers trembled slightly as she pulled a sticky note from the pad. She grabbed a marker and drew the symbol. Its shape came easily, like it lived in her hand, etched somewhere beyond conscious memory.

She stood, crossed to the board, and placed the sticky note in a grouping near a node that read: Collective memory / ancestral transmission. She reached for the red string and looped it around the tack, then pulled it taut and pinned it, connecting the symbol to ritual transmission. Then again to sacred geometry, co-occurring delusion, and unified myth.

She stepped back, staring. The board pulsed. Her chest fluttered.

She returned to her notebook and flipped to a new page.

The dream was not mine.
The voice said it is a place in time. Not a dream or imagination. A memory of a location. 

She wrote faster:

Natalie was there. Van and Tai were there. The others too. But not as they are now, or even as they were then.
They were stripped down. More raw. More true.
They belonged to It. Believers.

She pressed harder on the page, the pen nearly tearing the paper.

The symbol was already there. I thought we made it but we just remembered it. Natalie said "That's It". The mark of the It??? 

She circled the question. 

Her breath was shaky. She wrote smaller now, as if whispering to the page:

It chose me but It didn’t need me anymore. I said Natalie was the one.
But Natalie is mine.
So maybe It needs me still. Maybe that’s why It gave me the dream.

She stared at the page. The words buzzed like static, like fire crackling too close to her ears.

She stilled the metronome. The ticking stopped. The silence roared.

The words flowed out of her like a current. She barely looked at what she was writing. She just followed the pull of each idea to the next. Threads looped and doubled back. Shared memory, prophecy, recursion, hunger. The page filled. Then another. Her handwriting grew less legible, but she didn’t stop. She didn’t want to. She was so close to something.

The doorbell rang.

She froze.

For a moment, the sound didn’t register as real. Then it rang again, insistent. Her mind scrambled for meaning before landing on the obvious: her piano student.

“Shit.” She shoved the notebook aside, stood up fast enough to make her head spin. She caught sight of herself in the reflection of the office window. Her eyes were wide. Her hair was wild where she had gripped it as she wrote. 

She ran a hand through her hair and pinned it back with a clip. She straightened herself and took a breath. Then another. She tried to quiet the energy vibrating through her bones. Her skin still buzzed with the afterimage of the symbol. Of Natalie’s face. Of fire.

She opened the door.

“Hi Charlotte.” The girl wore a backpack and held her music folder in front of her like a shield.

"Good afternoon Adaysha." Lottie forced a smile. “Come on in.”

She led her to the piano and gestured to the bench. The girl sat, arranging her music. Lottie stayed standing for a second too long before finally lowering herself to the bench beside her.

“Let’s start with your scales.” Her voice was soft but detached.

The girl began. Her fingers moved tentatively over the keys. C major. Then G.

Lottie watched, but her mind wandered.

The notes blurred into a drone. The rhythm was wrong, hesitant and slightly off-time, but she didn’t correct it. She just nodded faintly. Her eyes drifted to the window, to the shifting leaves beyond it. Orange and gold. Flickers of fire.

“Again,” she said quietly, when the girl finished.

The girl blinked, unsure if she’d heard right. “Should I try a different one?”

“No,” Lottie murmured. “G again.”

The girl played again. And again. Lottie turned to a page in her music book and nodded for her to play without a word.

Her fingers tapped her leg in a rhythm entirely separate from the music. Her gaze was unfocused. She felt herself slipping sideways into the undercurrent again. Like something just beneath the surface was still speaking to her, and she didn’t want to lose her connection to it.


After the lesson ended, Lottie walked the girl to the door with polite, distracted thanks. The second it shut behind her, silence swept back over the apartment like a tide. Stillness pressed against her skin.

She drifted into the kitchen, half-conscious, and scanned the fridge. Her eyes landed on the taped-up schedule they’d made together—columns labeled with studio blocks, classes, practice hours, their dinners highlighted in orange. Her finger traced horizontally: Monday, Tuesday. The down along blocks of time until she arrived at the current hour. Studio: 6-9+.

She took otu her phone and dialed Natalie. She answered on the second ring with a heavy sigh. “Hey Lot.”

Her voice came over the line low, warm, a little worn. Lottie exhaled, some of the static inside her dissolving just from the sound of her voice.

“Hi baby. Sorry if you’re in the middle of something.”

“No. I’m just walking in.” A pause. She sounded like she was shifting something... her bag, maybe. “I miss you.”

Lottie closed her eyes, leaned against the counter. “I miss you too.”

“I... I keep feeling like... a gap. It’s like I can feel you not being near me." Lottie picked up on the nervousness in her voice. "I don't know. It's weird. I think it might be the gaze work... I feel loose... like I’m craving the tether.”

Lottie’s breath hitched at the word. Tether. “I know what you mean.” She tried to hide the tension in her own voice. “I’ve been... honestly, I’ve been a little unhinged today. I had this dream this morning... and it hasn’t let go of me.”

There was a soft sigh on the line.

Lottie’s stomach growled. Loud enough to pull her attention downward. She winced. “Have you eaten?”

“Not yet. I had a granola bar for breakfast but nothing since then. I’m gonna heat up some leftovers for dinner, I think.”

Lottie frowned. “I had a couple bites of the chicken this morning."

“It's ok. There should still be plenty left.” Her voice was tired but soothing. “I’m just settling into my drafting table now. I have that critique in the morning, so I’ll probably be here a while.”

Lottie glanced at the clock. The hour had already crept past 6.

“I’ll wait up for you.” she said.

“You don’t have to. It might get late.”

“I want to. I don't know if I could fall asleep without you anyway.” 

A pause. Then a soft, “Ok.”

Lottie lingered. “I love you.”

“I love you too.”

They stayed quiet for a moment longer before the line disconnected.

Lottie set the phone down, her hand still resting on it. The sound of Natalie’s voice clung to the air like warmth from a blanket just removed. It wasn’t enough to totally calm her, but it was enough for now.

She returned to the office, closing the door gently behind her. The incense had faded, but the memory of the smoke lingered. Her eyes moved to the graphite symbol on the frame. A still point in the room.

She sat at the desk, opened her notebook to a clean page, and wrote at the top:

Night 2 of 5: Suggestion Phrases

She tapped her pen lightly against the paper, then began. She wanted to guide Natalie towards what It had shared with her but maintain a therapeutic tone. If It wanted her to guide Natalie she'd have to be gentle and leave room for something deeper to emerge in her on its own.

Some things in you might not come from you, but they still belong to you. (spoken)

She nodded. That felt honest, good. Not too strange. The kind of thing Natalie could take in without alarm.

You can carry memories you don’t recognize. (sent)

The next pair came slower. She looked toward the metronome but didn’t start it.

You are listening. You don’t have to understand everything you hear. (spoken)

Some echoes reach forward. Let them become part of you. (sent)

She frowned slightly. That one unsettled her, even as she wrote it. She crossed it out. 

You are more than what you have experienced. (sent)

She let herself sit in the silence a while.

Then added:

When It shows you something, accept it. Let it become part of you. (spoken)

She could feel the pull again—like she was not entirely alone in the room.

If something feels familiar, don’t question it yet. Just stay open. (sent)

She finished the list with a breath and rested her pen.

The phrases weren’t overtly spiritual. But they weren’t neutral, either. They sat somewhere in between, just where they needed to be.

She closed the notebook. Let the voice stay quiet for now. She would offer these to Natalie gently. Like breadcrumbs.


Lottie was curled on the couch with a book in her lap, though she hadn’t turned a page in ten minutes. The living room was dim with the warm light of a floor lamp casting over her. She didn’t hear the key in the lock, only the gentle thud of the door closing and the soft sound of boots being removed. She looked up.

Natalie stepped into view, eyes shadowed, expression unreadable. She didn’t say hello. She crossed the room and lowered herself to her knees in front of Lottie, sighing as she sank down. Then she placed her head gently in Lottie’s lap with her eyes closed.

Her hand reached up, searching, and Lottie took it.

“Lottie.” Natalie spoke it like a confession, swollen with need.

Lottie stroked her hair. “I’m here, baby.”

They stayed like that, the silence between them taut but safe. Lottie felt Natalie’s weight, her warmth, her trust pressed into her thighs.

After a moment, she slipped her fingers beneath Natalie’s chin and tilted it upward. Her eyes met Natalie’s and held them as she guided her gently up onto the couch. Natalie climbed up beside her, curling into her, knees pulled close.

“How was your day?” Lottie asked softly.

“Hard. Long. It was pulling at me all day." Natalie breathed out heavily. "I think the ritual is making me... feel your absence more. I missed you. I missed you guiding me.”

Lottie’s hand settled at the back of her head. “I’m here now." He voice was wet with affection. "You did so well on your own.”

Natalie leaned in further, cheek pressing to Lottie’s collarbone. “I didn’t want to be on my own.”

Lottie let her cheek rest against Natalie’s hair. “I had a dream this morning.” She paused, considering. “More than a dream.”

Natalie shifted slightly, murmuring, “Yeah?”

“The wilderness.” Lottie's voice grew distant. “We were in this... cabin. In the woods. Our old soccer team was there. Van was there, in front of a fire, telling this story… a myth. She said the wilderness was lonely, so it built a house and waited. And then I..." She faltered, hestiant to share the part about Natalie. "And then it burned down.”

Natalie squeezed her. “Sounds scary.”

Lottie was quiet, considering. “I guess it was. But it wasn’t. I knew we were going to survive. It felt... like something that had already happened.”

“Have you ever been in a fire?”

Lottie shook her head. “No.”

“Do you think you will be?”

“No... I think it did happen to us, though. Just not here. Not in this life.”

Natalie studied her face. “Like a past life?”

“No, like in another version of this one.” Lottie spoke slowly, making sense of what she said as she said it. “One we didn’t get to live. But the memory still made it through.”

Natalie touched Lottie’s arm lightly. “Was I there?”

Lottie exhaled, her eyes far away again. “Yes, you were. You looked... tired. Like something in you had just broken. But you were... brave.” She considered for a moment. "You were you, just..."

Natalie looked up at her, waiting for her to finish her thought.

Lottie looked back. “You were the one It chose.”

Natalie didn’t answer right away but then settled into the idea. “I’m not afraid of that.”

Lottie nodded and gave her a faint smile. “I know.”

She traced a slow line down Natalie’s arm. “Come on. Let’s try to eat before bed.”

They moved into the kitchen and stood over the counter, picking at the leftovers in silence. A few bites passed between them, more out of necessity than hunger. Lottie set down her fork and touched her stomach.

“I think the hunger is part of it.” She spoke almost to herself. “The wilderness. It’s not just a place. It’s a feeling. A condition.”

Natalie didn’t disagree. 

"How are you feeling? Are you up for the ritual tonight?"

Natalie didn't hesitate. "Yes. I've bee nthinking about it all day. I want it."

Lottie nodded. "Ok, let's get cleaned up first."


They washed up slowly, together, the silence between them weighty but companionable. Lottie moved first, unpinning her hair and tying it back. Natalie mirrored her without being asked. The fell into a familiar rhythm of cleansing, brushing teeth, changing into soft clothes, it itself a ritual.

When they returned to the office, Lottie lit the candle. The flame shimmered, catching in Natalie’s eyes.

Natalie sat slowly, the movement almost a sink downward. She let out a low breath, eyes flickering up to Lottie, who was already sitting opposite her, notebook in hand, spine straight but clearly tired. The soft clicks of the metronome filled the room.

Lottie gave her a tired smile. “Ok. Let’s start.”

She clicked her pen and began. “How grounded do you feel in your body?”

Natalie closed her eyes for a second, rolling her shoulders back. “4... but it’s like... a heavy four. Like I’m here, but it’s taking effort to stay.”

Lottie nodded and wrote it down. “How calm or at ease do you feel right now?”

Natalie opened her eyes, looking directly at her. “3.”

Lottie paused. “That low?”

“I’m...” Natalie sighed, reaching up to run a hand through her hair. “It’s not anxiety exactly. It’s more like… I’ve been pulled all day. I’m just tired from It. It's not as gentle as you are.”

Lottie’s gaze softened, and she made a quick note. “How open do you feel to being guided?”

Natalie didn’t hesitate. “10.”

That made Lottie smile faintly. She looked back at the page. “How connected do you feel to me in this moment?”

Natalie’s jaw tightened slightly as she considered. “5.” She sounded almost ashamed.

Lottie looked up sharply, then softened. “That’s ok. That’s what this is for. Thank you for being honest.” She let a silence pass, then continued gently. “How present does It feel?”

Natalie answered without delay. “9.”

Lottie’s pen stilled. She met Natalie’s eyes and held them for a beat longer than the others.

Natalie blinked, then spoke like she was giving an excuse. “It was with me all day.”

Lottie reached out and brushed a knuckle down the side of her cheek, feather-light. “And you still missed me?”

Natalie closed her eyes and leaned into the touch. “Of course.”

They sat with that for a moment, the ticking steady around them. Lottie set the notebook aside and reached for Natalie’s hands, holding them between her own.

"Ok Natalie. Thank you. Are you ready for round one?"

Natalie sat up straighter. "Yes Lottie."

"Ok, remember to try to get to 60 with your count on the beats. I'll give you two suggestions: one spoken and one sent. Try to hold onto them." She started the timer and held Natalie's gaze.

The timer beeped after one minute. Lottie spoke directly into Natalie. "Some things in you might not come from you, but they still belong to you."

Natalie shifted. "Belong to me."

Lottie counted 20 beats with the metronome, then pushed silently: You can carry memories you don’t recognize.
