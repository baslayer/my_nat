<body>
  <p>In the morning Lottie rose from bed after the first alarm and told Natalie she’d come on the run with her.</p>

  <p>“Thank you Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>Nat loved to run alongside Lottie. Nat watched her as she kept an effortless grace, head high with good posture, her shoulders relaxed as she kept a strenuous pace. She watched her long legs and focused on trying to keep time with her, matching the stride and period of her steps. </p>
  
  <p>When they returned, Lottie offered to let her shower first.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, Lottie. It’s ok. I think you need more time to get ready than I do.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you, Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat fought the urge to bow to her. “You’re welcome Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>As Lottie showered, Nat prepared the bags then went to her desk to read from her trig book. She read about polar coordinates and complex numbers and worked problems utilizing De Moivre’s Theorem. </p>
  
  <p>Looking at the page of exercises, she felt a deep love for it, how it looked like gibberish at first but then revealed itself as a testament to something huge and quiet and almost invisible. The idea of complex numbers, the union of real and imaginary, numbers that couldn’t be seen but somehow were still <em> true </em> made her feel deeply poetic and gifted that she was able to bear witness to it.</p>
  
  <p>When she heard Lottie cut the shower, her mind went back to her. Lottie was so <em> complex </em> . Lottie was <em> real </em> , but also sometimes Nat thought Lottie could be <em> imaginary. </em> Whatever the hell she was trying to make sense of, she didn’t know, but then she thought of Lottie’s voice, her dark eyes, and the place they took her. She looked at the page and thought of the complex plane and <em> imaginary space </em>. </p>
  
  <p>
    <em> Imaginary space. </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>“Your turn.”</p>
  
  <p>She nodded to Lottie and moved to the bathroom, trying to stay on the train of thought the work had taken her to. </p>
  
  <p>She didn’t understand it completely. She didn’t need to. She just knew that something as strange and made-up as an <em> i </em> could still belong in the equation. Could still be used to find something real.</p>
  
  <p>She thought of her and Lottie, how hard it was to make sense of it if she clung to hard logic. Not the inexplicable feelings, not the way time bent when they were together, not the way Nat felt whenever Lottie really <em> looked </em> at her. She and Lottie… she hummed as she thought of herself as part of the pair, an impossible combination of real and imagined, irrational and perfect. Spinning through space together, carving out some secret, circular path.</p>
  
  <p>She emerged from the shower with the feeling of having been baptized. She felt changed, like she had discovered a divine truth that now bolstered her and gave reason to what had been unreasonable prior to her revelation. </p>
  
  <p>She entered the room and now saw it differently. Not just her new home, but the site of her awakening, her transformation into the Nat that belonged with Lottie. She looked around and thought of who she’d been before and how she’d been caught in Lottie’s orbit. She felt in her rightful place, the real with the complex, herself a half of a pair that described truth. </p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at Lottie like she was seeing her for the first time. </p>
  
  <p>She sat at her vanity in the morning light, brushing her hair back in slow, practiced motions, skin glowing in a way that felt completely unearthly. She looked transcendent, almost luminous as the sun entered the windows and shone upon her. The whole room was filled with her, the soft scent of her perfume, the stillness she carried like a spell. She was all grace, all light, and Natalie felt like a shadow beside her. But a shadow with purpose.</p>
  
  <p>Without thinking, Natalie crossed the room and dropped to her knees beside her.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie blinked in surprise and looked down. “Yes Natalie?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie didn’t answer right away. She rested her head on Lottie’s thighs and took her hand.</p>
  
  <p>“I love you so much, Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“I love you too.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked up at her. “It’s not just love though. It’s something else. I was just working some problems and…” she looked into Lottie and found the place behind her eyes “... I thought of how things can be real and complex and imaginary and how perfect it can all be and I think I figured it out. That’s what you’ve done to me. You’ve made me belong in some equation I thought I’d never be good enough to even look at.”</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Natalie </em>.”</p>
  
  <p>She felt the gentle tendrils of Lottie’s gaze tickling her brainstem. She leaned into the feeling of being pulled into Lottie. “I worship you, Lottie. Like I’d do anything you asked, even if it hurt. I want to be near you. I want to be <em> yours </em>.”</p>
  
  <p>A long moment passed. Then Lottie reached down and gently tucked a wet strand of hair behind Nat’s ear. Her fingers lingered, and Nat closed her eyes at the touch. It felt like benediction.</p>
  
  <p>“You’re mine,” Lottie whispered, voice calm and sure.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie’s fingers moved slowly through Natalie’s wet hair, stroking the strands with care, like she was smoothing the edges off something wild. Natalie stayed still in her lap, barely breathing, holding onto her gaze.</p>
  
  <p>“You’re mine,” Lottie repeated. “I’m yours, too.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie felt the world melting away. Lottie’s words echoed in her, gaining strength and becoming more concrete. Their meaning settled in her bones, fortifying the core of her being. Her whole body felt raw, stripped bare, nerves sparking from every inch of skin. The intensity of Lottie’s gaze pinned her in place.</p>
  
  <p>And then Lottie leaned in.</p>
  
  <p>Their mouths met with quiet devotion that built fast and hard. Natalie let out a breathless sound against Lottie’s lips, grabbing for her, one hand bracing against the vanity, the other sinking into Lottie’s lap like she needed to anchor herself or risk drowning in a dark sea.</p>
  
  <p>Their kiss grew hotter, deeper, Lottie’s hand sliding to the back of Natalie’s neck, holding her there like she couldn’t let her go. Natalie kissed her like she was starving. She felt all the days of confusion melt away and in its place a supreme truth form. </p>
  
  <p>Lottie moaned softly against her mouth, and the sound broke Natalie open. She pushed up from her knees, letting her towel fall and climbing into Lottie’s lap, straddling her now on the vanity stool, damp skin pressed against silk robe, heart hammering.</p>
  
  <p>“God, Nat…” Lottie whispered, forehead against hers.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie’s hands moved with confidence, moving gently along Nat’s thighs and grabbing at her ass, pulling her cheeks apart in strong hands. She grabbed at Nat like she already knew every part of Natalie’s body from knowing what she was made of before Natalie even figured it out herself. </p>
  
  <p>Natalie moaned into the kiss, savoring the feeling of being handled by Lottie. Lottie clocked it and encouraged her. “That’s right baby. Let me take care of you, my sweet pet.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie kept one hand gripping her ass and moved the other so it settled on her bare thigh, warm and steady. Nat felt the anticipation building in her. “Thank you Lottie. Thank you for taking care of me.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie kept up with the praise in NAtalie’s ear. “So good. So smart. So good for me.”</p>
  
  <p>Her breath hitched when Lottie’s fingers slid between her folds, parting her gently, confidently. Natalie gasped softly, her hands moving to Lottie’s shoulders as her body jolted. Lottie kissed her jaw, her throat, the places on her neck she knew Natalie loved. Slow, careful, precise. </p>
  
  <p>Natalie was already slick, already pulsing around her, like her body had been waiting for this. “So wet for me,” Lottie murmured, a smile in her voice.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie whimpered, rolling her hips against Lottie’s hand. “It’s yours… I’m yours…”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie moaned low, and the sound drove Natalie crazy. She couldn’t stop moving, her body finding rhythm in Lottie’s palm, every nerve ending lit. She buried her face in Lottie’s neck, panting, her breath hot and desperate.</p>
  
  <p>“Look at me,” Lottie commanded her.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie lifted her head, eyes glassy, lips parted. She felt herself sinking, going deeper into the place where it was only them. Pleasure took her over as everything else left her mind. Lottie kissed her again. It was deep, a claim. Then her fingers slid inside her, curling just right. </p>
  
  <p>Nat cried out softly against her mouth, her whole body arching as her orgasm bloomed like a firework from her center.</p>
  
  <p>She relaxed against the taller girl, her body limp and her head blissfully empty. She was panting. “Thank you Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>“You’re welcome Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat didn’t move.</p>
  
  <p>“Natalie, it’s time to get ready for school.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie stood with shaking legs and retrieved her towel from the floor. “Yes Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Natalie followed Lottie through the halls with tunnel vision. When she approached Lottie and she was with someone, Nat was sure to wait until they were finished speaking before greeting them, friends first, endeavoring to earn her requisite forehead kiss.</p>
  
  <p>After homeroom, she walked Lottie to DeMartino’s room and turned in her essay. Lottie praised her “Good job, Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>At lunch, Nat found Lottie in the line and followed her to a new spot, far from others. Nat asked Lottie how her history class was, and they laughed together at DeMartino’s intensity. “He asked Jeff how Cato contributed to the Third Punic War and when he didn’t know, he practically screamed <em> Damn it Jeff. How many times did the man say it? Carthage must be destroyed! </em> You could see the veins coming out of his head.” Nat enjoyed the one-on-one conversation with Lottie over sitting with her in the group.  </p>
  
  <p>After lunch, Nat found Lottie outside her calc class and walked with her and Laura Lee to the locker room. During stretches Lottie prompted her to join the conversation and encouraged her to partner with others for drills. Nat did so reluctantly but dutifully with the knowledge that she was doing as Lottie had asked.</p>
  
  <p>On the way to the diner, she rode in the back seat and sat quietly while Laura Lee and Lottie discussed an upcoming test. “Well Lottie, if Nat is so good at math, maybe she can help you study.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat’s ears perked up at her name. “What?”</p>
  
  <p>“I was just saying Nat, maybe you could help Lottie study for our test next week.”</p>
  
  <p>“What’s it on?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie answered her. “Limits and continuity”</p>
  
  <p>“Is there any trig?”</p>
  
  <p>“Some. It’s mostly algebra.”</p>
  
  <p>“I can try.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you, Natalie. I’d really like that.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>At the diner, the team was abuzz with the conclusion of tryouts and the prospect of having some new teammates.</p>
  
  <p>Jackie turned to Nat. “So Nat, who do you think it’s going to be? You’re our man on the inside.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked up. “Oh, um, that girl Allie looked good. She’ll probably make it.”</p>
  
  <p>“That’s one! Sounds like we’ll have to have a party. Initiation rites.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat turned her attention back to Lottie’s hand. She was holding one in her lap, fiddling with her fingers.</p>
  
  <p>Van started a side conversation. “Hey Nat”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah?”</p>
  
  <p>“We’re thinking the 4:30 show. Party Girl. You guys still coming?”</p>
  
  <p>“Uh, hold on.” She tugged on Lottie’s hand and whispered in her ear. </p>
  
  <p>Lottie answered for them. “Yeah Van. Sounds good. We’ll meet you out front at 4:15.”</p>
  
  <p>“Cool Lot.” Van watched as Nat went back to focusing on Lottie’s hand.</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Back in the room, Nat was eager. “Hey Lot, do you have the notes for the test?”</p>
  
  <p>“Um, yes.” She retrieved a notebook from her backpack. “It’s the first unit so it’s all the notes in here.”</p>
  
  <p>“Do you have any practice problems?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled at her. “Yes” She pulled out a binder and handed it to her. “Think you can handle it?”</p>
  
  <p>“I’ll try.”</p>
  
  <p>She sat at her desk and studied the topics diligently for hours. She found the topics <em> did </em> involve a fair amount of algebra, and her ability to recall the techniques gave her confidence. When a trig function came up, she felt a warm familiarity, like running into an old friend. <em> What are you doing here, secant? </em></p>
  
  <p>Lottie watched her work as the evening dimmed into night. She rose and turned on the desk lamp for her, and kissed the top of her head. “How’s it going baby?”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s good. We can do some practice tomorrow.”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m going to go downstairs and play piano. Are you going to keep working?”</p>
  
  <p>“Do you want me to come down with you?”</p>
  
  <p>“What would you like to do?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat felt the burden of choice. “Oh, um. I… uh…” She looked back at the papers scattered on the desk.</p>
  
  <p>“You can stay up here and work.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“You’re welcome Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Natalie wasn’t sure when exactly she’d drifted off. One moment she was organizing her notes and stacking Lottie’s binders with delicate affection, the next she was stepping out of a hot shower with her hair still damp and her mind softened. She didn’t remember climbing into bed, only the sensation of cool sheets and the faint ache in her shoulders from hunching over equations for hours.</p>
  
  <p>The faint sound of Lottie’s piano had been the last thing in her ears. That same melody, again and again, like it had sunk into her skin.</p>
  
  <p>She stirred slightly when the shower started again. Her body recognized the sound before her mind did. <em> Lottie. </em> Still up. Still moving like a spirit through their room.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie stayed curled on her side, half-asleep, drifting in the warm, quiet dark. The bathroom door opened and the room filled with soft humidity. Then the bed shifted. The familiar weight of Lottie’s body joined hers, settling behind her.</p>
  
  <p>She turned slowly, her legs tangling with Lottie’s, the cotton of her shirt cool against Natalie’s thigh. She nuzzled into her shoulder and pressed a kiss just below her collarbone. “Your turn,” she whispered, voice thick with sleep.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie tensed, just slightly. “Hmm?”</p>
  
  <p>But Natalie was already moving, her hand sliding with slow certainty beneath the shirt. Her fingers brushed over Lottie’s stomach, then down, exploring gently, reverently.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie gasped softly, her breath catching.</p>
  
  <p>Her eyes were still mostly closed, but her touch was purposeful — slow and devoted, like prayer made flesh. In her sleepy daze she wanted to worship Lottie, wanted to give her something wordless the way she did for her. She’d spent all day trying to be good, to be <em> useful </em> , to be sharp, to be precise. This was where she got to <em> serve </em>.</p>
  
  <p>She found Lottie’s clit with her fingers and started working in slow, small circles, lips brushing her neck. “You feel so good, Lot,” she murmured. “You always feel so good.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie’s hand found her wrist, but didn’t stop her — just gripped, tight, grounding. Her breath began to come faster, shallower.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie smiled against her skin, eyes fluttering closed again. “Does it feel good, Lottie? I love making you feel good.”</p>
  
  <p>She moved her fingers lower, slipping between folds now slick and warm, drawing slow shapes of devotion. Then, as Lottie moaned softly into the crook of her elbow, Natalie slid two fingers inside, her rhythm unbroken.</p>
  
  <p>“Good girl,” Lottie breathed, hips lifting into her hand.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie could’ve cried from it. From the words. From the way Lottie sounded. From being allowed to give her this.</p>
  
  <p>She kept going, whispering words of devotion, “so perfect,” "I'm yours", spoken with more breath than thought, her whole body working like she was born to do this. To serve her. To please her.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie came with a soft cry, biting down on Nat’s shoulder to muffle it, her body tensing around Natalie’s fingers. Natalie felt her pulse through her fingertips, felt her teeth press into her skin. Only then did she slow, then still.</p>
  
  <p>She withdrew gently and kissed the corner of Lottie’s mouth, still mostly asleep, her head foggy and full of stars.</p>
  
  <p>“I love you,” she mumbled.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie didn’t answer, but she didn’t need to. Natalie felt her breathing slow again, felt the calm settle around them like a blanket. And with a final sleepy sigh, Natalie tucked herself against her again and sank back into the dark, completely content.</p>
