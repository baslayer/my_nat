<title>Stormy Day</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    <span>Saturday morning was rainy as the remnants of a tropical storm passed over the Garden State. Nat woke to the sound of heavy drops pattering at the window pane and a dim orange light shining through the blinds. She felt Lottie around her and held still, closing her eyes and drifting back into a half-sleep. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She focused on the white noise of the rain, letting it hold her between worlds. She basked in the space and found herself aware of its familiarity. It reminded her of Lottie, as everything now did, and made her think of the place behind her eyes. She willed herself to sink deeper into it but resisted full sleep.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She projected the feeling of the real arms around her into her mind's eye, as if Lottie were in the place with her, holding her there. She thought of Lottie's voice, "I love being here with you". It echoed off unseen walls in her vision. Only darkness surrounded them but the voice comprised a thick atmosphere that made her feel they were enclosed in a tight space.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then she was looking at herself being held. She saw the two of them under a spotlight on a dark stage locked in a tight embrace. She watched as she looked up at Lottie, spoke her words of devotion "I love you Lottie," then descended to her knees, keeping her eyes on her. She saw Lottie tenderly stroke her head and praise her "I know baby. You're so good."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She watched as Lottie lightly pressed on her shoulder, guiding her down further. "Lay down." She felt in herself the gratitude from the praise, and desire to obey Lottie's command and receive more, and watched herself take to the ground and lie at Lottie's feet. "Good girl."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Real words escaped her lips, "Thank you Lottie."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stirred and answered her, still half asleep "You're welcome baby".</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat hummed at the sound of her voice, at the feeling the pet name gave her. Thunder rumbled outside and the sound entered Nat's mind, punctuating the intensity of her feelings. She felt a fullness in her chest that grew into a lump in her throat, and eventually spilled out of her eyes in the form of tears. She squeezed her eyes against the sting of the saltiness and felt drops fall along her face.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie began to stir more. Nat felt her body gain shape, no longer Limp from sleep. She stretched herself around Nat then held her with renewed strength. “Good morning Natalie”.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>"Good morning Lottie."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie heard the congestion in Nat's voice, the subtle indication that she was speaking through tears, and held her tighter. "What's wrong baby?"</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>"Nothing. I just….. I don't know." She wanted to answer but couldn't find words to explain the reason for the eruption of tears.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie grew concerned. "Is everything ok?"</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie answered automatically, "Yes Lottie."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>"Are you crying?"</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>"No. "</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie raised herself on her elbow and looked at Natalie. Her eyes were held shut, her face slightly contorted, and tears were streaming into dark spots on the pillow. Lottie kissed her cheek and tenderly put her hair behind her ear. "It's ok Natalie. Did you have a bad dream?"</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>"No. I... um..." Natalie searched for an explanation and found only Lottie’s words in her head. "I love being here with you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She spoke the phrase like a mantra, part expression and part compulsion. The words hung in the air as Lottie returned to her place behind Nat and reembraced her. Nat settled in her arms like a part of Lottie’s whole, as the sounds of the storm threaded through her drifting mind pulling her into quiet shared dreamscape.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie.</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I think we should get out of bed soon.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded and rose easily, slipping from Lottie to the edge of the bed in one fluid motion. She looked out the window and concluded she wouldn’t be starting her morning with her run. She sat at the bed, undecided and unsure of how to proceed. She turned to Lottie. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What do I do now?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well, I can’t go for my run. I usually run first.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What would you like to do?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She looked about the space. She saw the desk and then looked back to Lottie. “Didn’t you want me to help you prepare for your calc test?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you up for it? You were studying for a long time last night.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Why don’t you get cleaned up first, and I’ll make some breakfast.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie sighed with relief, happy to have some direction. “Thanks Lot”. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie heard her relaxed tone and smiled at her. “You’re welcome Nat”.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie returned to find Nat back at the desk. She approached from behind and took her by the shoulders. "Come eat Natalie." She kissed the top of her head.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie turned and nodded and followed her to the kitchen table.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They ate in silence as Nat's mind warmed itself up for the upcoming study session. She thought about limits and how they made sense. She had been in their world for hours last night, and had started to romanticize them in the same way she had her trig concepts. She thought of how she could approach something, get closer and closer to it, without ever quite reaching it, but still know it was there. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat envisioned the day before her and anticipated opportunities to garner Lottie's praise. She felt excited at the prospect of explaining her vision of limits to help Lottie, bringing two things she loved together. She smiled to herself at the thought of double dipping a task to get double pleasure. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She thought of what they’d do after studying, the day prospectively set to be confined to the house. She pictured herself sitting patiently, waiting for Lottie's direction, and the image of her own subservience made her feel needy in the most pleasurable way.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When they returned to the room Lottie directed Nat to sit on the bed. Nat watched as she collected the materials from the desk and brought them to the bed. She took out a packet of photocopied textbook pages and presented them to Nat.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“These are the review exercises at the end of the chapter. The teacher said if we can do these, we’ll have no problem.” Nat nodded along. “I have the odd answers from the back of the book copied, too, but the evens are harder and they don’t print the answers. Even for some of the odds, I don’t know how they got to the answer. There isn’t a step-by-step solution.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat knew the format from her trig textbook and offered an approach with confidence. “We can do the odds you’re having trouble with together, then we can try the evens on our own and see if we get matching solutions.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled at her. “Ok Nat, good plan.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was excited. The first problem Lottie had trouble with contained a removable discontinuity. She saw where Lottie’s error was and confidently solved the right hand side and the left hand side correctly, demonstrating a convergence that she had missed.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The next problem Lottie had solved her right hand side wrong, and had assumed convergence where the answer was that the limit did not exist. Again, she worked the algebra carefully, describing each step as she worked, and checking with Lottie periodically to confirm understanding.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie laughed at herself as she replicated Nat’s work and found solutions that had eluded her before. “You’re really good at this, Nat.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt the warmth of pride flood her chest. She ducked her head and let out a shaky laugh, sitting with the feeling of  Lottie’s praise. “Yeah, I like it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Her fingers were twitched, desperate for something more to do. Another function to trace. Another way to please. “Can I do the evens on my own now?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“If you’d like.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She pulled the packet into her lap and started scanning the next problem. The functions blurred a little in her peripheral vision as she felt herself become enraptured by them. The puzzle, the pursuit. Lottie watching her. Lottie needing her. Doing the math made her feel powerful, capable, and the way her ability pleased Lottie made her feel perfect.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They worked through the morning. Lottie worked her problems but kept her eyes on Nat. She saw how she worked steadily, her pencil moving in smooth strokes transcribing the workings of her mind onto the page. Natalie began to hum as she worked, and Lottie recognized the tune from her piano.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she finished, Nat looked up at Lottie, breaking out of her zone. “Done with those. Do you want me to check yours?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie shook her head. “I’m not done yet. You’re too fast for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She laid back on the bed and listened to the rain. She envisioned lines traversing planes, approaching each other only to change direction at the last second, and continue into opposite infinities. She worked problems in her head over again, and periodically double-checked what she’d written to confirm its correctness. She watched Lottie work, saw how she’d furrow her brow and erase at times, then nod when another try worked out better.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok, Nat. Let’s check.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When they were done Natalie looked at Lottie, almost pleading, “Did I help?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Natalie. You’ve helped a lot. Thank you, my brilliant girl.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat relaxed at the compliment. “You’re welcome, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her, and Nat held her gaze. More than the gratitude she craved the reward. Nat felt her excitement from the morning exercising her mind transform into something heavier, needier. She felt it low in her stomach as she looked deeper, the desire to be under Lottie again, the craving for the relief of submission after intellectual exertion, like earned oblivion.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She crawled toward Lottie on the bed, scattering papers as she moved, keeping her eyes fixed. She felt the pull tug her like gravity. Her whole body felt electric, alive with the tension of the tether.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she reached Lottie, she settled on her knees and let her hands rest lightly on her thighs.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Did I do well for you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie gave her a sly smile and raised an eyebrow. “Yes. You were very good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Then, um, maybe… I deserve a reward?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie let out a nervous laugh. She didn’t answer right away, she broke her gaze and ran her eyes over Natalie. Her posture, her tone. She was so… submissive. Her breath started to come rapidly, and Nat saw. She pushed further.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m tired Lottie… my head needs a rest. I need your help.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie let out another laugh, not out of humor, but out of acquiescence. “Is my sweet baby tired of being brilliant?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She looked into Nat again and Nat caught it instantly and tried to focus behind her eyes, hungry for the feeling. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Please Lot. I know you can do it more… it feels so good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’ve been so good for me baby, but I think you need a little more training. It’s not up to you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt the victory of pulling Lottie into her game. She let out a pathetic whine, feigning complaint.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie leaned forward slowly until her mouth was just above Natalie’s ear.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You think just because you’ve helped me with math, you get to ask for these things?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shivered, her breath hitching. “No, Lottie…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No,” Lottie echoed, her voice firmer now. “It’s not about what you </span>
    <em>
      <span>want</span>
    </em>
    <span>, Natalie. It’s about what I decide you </span>
    <em>
      <span>need</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie.” Her hands trembled in her lap. Her mind had already begun to recede as she’d held Lottie’s gaze.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stood from the bed, towering above her now. She looked down at Natalie with narrowed eyes, like she was making a decision. Then she gave a command.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Take off your clothes.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie obeyed without a word, tugging her shirt over her head and shimmying out of her pants. She folded everything neatly beside her hoping Lottie would notice. When she knelt again, naked and waiting, she went back to Lottie’s eyes and held herself there.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie sat on the edge of the bed. “Come.” She patted the spot in front of her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You were good this morning,” she said, brushing her fingers along Natalie’s breast. “But being good doesn’t mean you get to </span>
    <em>
      <span>decide</span>
    </em>
    <span> what comes next.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I reward you because you’re mine,” she murmured, voice growing lower with mounting confidence. “Not because you beg.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie whimpered, sinking deeper into the haze, her limbs growing limp in Lottie’s hold.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Do you want to thank me properly, baby?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded, desperate. “Yes Lottie. Thank you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lie back. Keep your hands where I can see them. And don’t make a sound unless I say so.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie obeyed instantly, spine melting into the mattress, her body humming.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked her over. Natalie felt her eyes on her and felt the rush from being on display again. She sunk into the feeling of being tuned to Lottie. She felt the tall girl sit beside her, then let her fingers drift lightly over Natalie’s stomach, just grazing her, coaxing every inch of skin into attention.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I want to see how long you’ll last.” Lottie spoke as if she were speaking to herself and not Nat. As if she were just a thing to be toyed with.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s body was already arching subtly under Lottie’s touch, her breath shallow and quick, eyes wide but unfocused.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You get so worked up,” Lottie went on, her fingers now tracing Natalie’s ribs, the curve of her waist, “just from the </span>
    <em>
      <span>idea</span>
    </em>
    <span> of being good.” She let her hand settle just above Natalie’s pubic bone, pressing lightly, threatening pleasure. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie leaned down, her mouth brushing the shell of her ear. “I can feel your heart racing.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s thighs squeezed together involuntarily. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie finally let her hand slip lower, parting Natalie’s legs with the lightest pressure. Her fingers ran through her folds, just enough to gather the wetness already there. Natalie exhaled through her nose, trembling from the restraint of not being allowed to speak.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Look at you,” Lottie whispered. “You want me to ruin you right now, don’t you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded once, hard. Her whole body was begging, even if her mouth stayed obediently shut.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She rubbed her clit in slow, delicate circles, just enough pressure to tease, to build the heat, to make Natalie’s hips rise. Then she stopped. “But you’ll just have to be patient.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Let her fingers hover. Natalie moaned loudly despite herself, and it earned a sharp look.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What did I say?” Lottie spoke dangerously soft.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie swallowed. “I’m sorry Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, I don’t think you are. You’re not sorry yet.” Lottie pulled her hand away completely. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then Lottie straddled her and pinned her arms above her head with one hand, holding her down and leaning in with her full weight. “Hands stay here.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She leaned down, her hair falling like a curtain around them. Natalie felt her own breath bounce off Lottie’s lips. “You belong to me.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You don’t come until I say.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded. “Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie kissed her then with possessive hunger. Her tongue slid into Natalie’s mouth as her fingers returned to their work, slow at first, then faster, circling and stroking, dipping down to slide inside her and back up again. She didn’t settle on a rhythm. She didn’t give Natalie anything to rely on. Natalie felt she was trying to drive her mad.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s hips bucked. Her hands gripped at the sheets but stayed where Lottie held them. She knew she was close — painfully close — and Lottie knew it too. That was the point.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Just when she was about to fall, Lottie pulled her hand away again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie let out a pathetic sob. “Please Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No.” Lottie was calm. In control. “You can wait because you </span>
    <em>
      <span>will</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Her fingers returned with even more precision this time. She rubbed Natalie’s clit with the pad of her thumb, slow and steady, while her other fingers slid inside and curled.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie writhed beneath her, gasping, eyes wide and glassy. And once again, Lottie withdrew her touch.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie let out another desperate sob, hips twitching. Her thighs trembled from holding back. Every muscle in her body was on fire with denial.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No.” The word cut clean through the haze, sharp and absolute. “All this begging and I never said you could speak.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m sorry Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You come when </span>
    <em>
      <span>I</span>
    </em>
    <span> say, not when your body gets greedy.” Lottie shifted her weight, settling herself more firmly over Natalie’s hips, pinning her down. “You wanted this, remember?” she continued, leaning over her, voice silk wrapped around steel. “You wanted me to take it from you.” She gazed into Nat again, with full intention, pushing her deep rapidly. She felt the girl grow limp beneath her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You will take what I give you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Take what you give me.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled at the repeated phrase. “That’s better.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie moved her eyes away, leaving Nat in a fog. She cupped one breast, fingers kneading firmly, not gently, and pinched the nipple hard between thumb and forefinger. Natalie arched up into the pain, a broken sound catching in her throat. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re so sensitive.” Lottie was watching her. “So easy to control.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She pinched again, harder, twisting slightly. Natalie choked on her breath, her thighs clenching instinctively.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re dripping,” Lottie observed. “You love when I hurt you, don’t you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie. I love it when you hurt me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie moved to the other nipple, biting it gently with her teeth, then followed it with a sharp slap across Natalie’s chest. The sting bloomed immediately and Natalie let out a breathy cry, not from pain, but from the pleasure beneath it. The submission. The proof that Lottie could do anything to her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You take it so well,” Lottie praised, soothing her hand over the reddened skin, then trailing back down her torso. Then her fingers returned and Natalie sobbed in relief. Lottie stroked her slowly, deliberately, building her up again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re going to hold it this time,” Lottie said. “No whining. No begging.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded furiously, her whole body twitching under the force of restraint, from the growing anticipation.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie edged her again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>And again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She brought her to the edge and pulled back, made her cry out, and started again, whispering cruel, sweet things.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“This is all you’re good for right now. Just a little body for me to play with, just like you wanted. You were so clever this morning, and now look at you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie loved it. She felt it in her bones, the ache of being used, the pleasure of being stripped of her control. The more Lottie took from her, the more she wanted to give. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After the fourth edge, Natalie was trembling uncontrollably, her voice gone raw with forced silence as she tried to be quiet.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lottie, </span>
    <em>
      <span>please.</span>
    </em>
    <span>” She whispered it, eyes pleading.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I know, baby,” Lottie cooed, soft now, brushing her fingers lightly over her clit. “You’ve been so good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She applied pressure again. “This time you can.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shattered. Her orgasm tore through her violently, her body locking and then releasing in waves of electric aftershocks. She sobbed against Lottie’s chest, breath catching as pleasure throbbed out of her in rhythmic pulses.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“There you go. That’s my good girl.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt like she was dissolving. She sank deeper into the mattress, boneless and quiet.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie had just begun to drift into the full exhaustion of release. Her body was limp. Her breath slowed. Her eyes were closed. She let herself float in the warm quiet, blissed out and happily satisfied.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>But Lottie shifted beside her, sitting up slowly. The bed dipped as she moved, and Natalie’s eyes fluttered open.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie,” Lottie said softly.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Mmm?” Nat barely managed the sound.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie leaned over her, brushing hair off her damp forehead. Her expression was unreadable, somewhere between pity and hunger. “You’re not done yet.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie blinked slowly, her body heavy. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stroked her cheek with two fingers still wet from work. “I know you’re tired, baby. But I still need you.” She gazed into the girl below her, her voice like a siren. Natalie felt her pull.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’ve been so patient.” Lottie leaned back and took her shirt off revealing her flushed skin, her chest rising with shallow breath. “I took care of you. You’ll take care of me now, won’t you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s breath hitched. She felt it again, the tether, the pull. It was stronger now, wrapping around her spine and pulling her upright like a puppet on a string.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good girl. Come here.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie moved toward her on weak limbs, crawling, holding her eyes on Lottie’s mesmerizing gaze. She collapsed into Lottie’s lap, face resting on her thigh, and looked up.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie cradled her jaw. “You’re so easy to lead when you’re like this.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Easy to lead.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie chuckled, delighted, and leaned back against the headboard.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You need me, don’t you Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“I need you.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Her eyes didn’t leave Natalie’s as she slid her shorts off, revealing to the dazed blonde how wet she had become from using her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You see what you do to me when you’re like this? You make me so wet when you’re good for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie was far gone. The words entered her and echoed, but she could no longer speak. She kept her eyes fixed on Lottie’s, despite the brunette’s provocations.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Now Natalie, I want you to please me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie didn’t hesitate. She lowered herself between Lottie’s thighs, kissing slowly, moving on instinct. She started at the inside of her thigh and moved to the crease of her hip, then to her moist curls. Every sound Lottie made landed heavily in Nat’s head, driving her forward. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s exhaustion fell away, replaced with a singular purpose: to please. To serve. To make Lottie feel what she had just felt, that perfect, obliterating ecstasy. It wasn’t a conscious endeavor, but an automatic fulfillment of the inevitable. She felt her body move without impulse, as thought Lottie’s need controlled her motion.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie’s fingers tangled in her hair. “That’s it. Just like that, baby.” She was so wet already, and Natalie licked slowly, deliberately, her tongue drawing slow, lazy circles around her clit, then flattening against it with pressure that made Lottie gasp.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes,” Lottie breathed, hips rolling. “I knew you’d be so good for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Her grip in Natalie’s hair tightened. Natalie moaned softly, the vibration making Lottie shudder.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re mine.” Lottie whispered, more to herself now. “You always were.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie answered with her mouth, with her tongue, with her whole body bent in worship. When Lottie came, Natalie felt it in her bones, in her soul. A wave crashing over them both.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie cried out, sharp and sudden, her whole body tightening around Natalie, pulling her closer, holding her there like she never wanted to let go.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When it was over, Natalie stayed there, face still resting against Lottie’s thigh, lips parted, body soft again. Lottie stroked her hair and watched her breathe deep and slow.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You did so good, baby. You made me feel so perfect.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie let out a small, grateful sound, barely on the edge of consciousness.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They stayed like that for a long time, basking in the music of the storm outside.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie’s legs were still parted, her breathing slow and satisfied. Natalie curled against her thigh, warm cheek resting on smooth skin, her eyes half-closed. She traced soft circles with her fingertips along Lottie’s calf, not ready to move, not ready to think.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Everything felt distant to Nat. The rain, the bed, even her body. The world had narrowed to Lottie’s hand in her hair and the rhythm of her breath. She felt emptied out, smoothed over.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie hummed a few notes from something she’d played on the piano the night before. Natalie smiled lazily.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you still here?” Lottie whispered, brushing a thumb along Natalie’s temple.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie.” She whispered back.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat didn’t know how long the peace lasted, but too soon they heard the phone ringing from downstairs. Moments later there was a knock at the door.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Don’t come in.” Lottie gave a warning.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Miss Matthews. There is a boy on the phone, he is calling for Miss Natalie. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They looked at each other. Nat’s mind raced. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Who had this number?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uh, one sec.” She answered the staff member uneasily.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They dressed themselves quickly and went downstairs where Natalie took the call.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Um, hello?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie?” </span>
    <em>
      <span>Kevyn.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie looked at Lottie. “Hey Kev.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Dude. Where are you? Whose house is this?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was exhausted. She sighed. “What are you talking about? You called here.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know dude. I’m at your house and your mom said you weren’t home but then I checked your room. I saw this number on your mirror so I called.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What the fuck? Why are you going in my room?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I thought you mighta been there”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well I’m not. So why you callin?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I kinda was worried. Like, are you gonna tell me where you are or what?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She looked at Lottie again. “I’m uh, at Lottie’s house.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That girl you been hanging with?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat put her head in her hand, exhausted by the stupidity of the question. “Yes Kevyn.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie took the phone from her. “Hello?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat watched her, bewildered.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Is this Kevyn?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>…</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“This is Lottie. How are you doing?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>…</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nat’s good, thank you for asking. She was helping me study today. What can I do for you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>…</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, I don’t think she was planning on leaving. We have plans tomorrow and she was going to stay the night.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>…</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, I don’t see why not. Do you have a car?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>…</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok, do you have a pen? I’ll give you directions.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“See you soon.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She hung up. “Kevyn’s coming over.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What?” Nat felt the shock of the statement wash over her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Do I need to repeat myself?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Why did you invite him?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“He seemed like he was really upset. Should I have not done that?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt herself reject the idea that Lottie had done wrong. “No, it’s ok.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good. We can all have dinner.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>By the time Kevyn was ringing the doorbell, Nat felt like a ghost in her own skin. They had set the table for three. She had never seen Kevyn eat at a table and felt sick at the notion of him sitting at the same table she shared with Lottie every day.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Before answering the door, Lottie offered an encouraging look to Nat followed by a soft reminder. “Good behavior. No fights.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She nodded. “Yes Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then Lottie was opening the door, greeting Kevyn warmly, as though they were old friends. Natalie could tell Kevyn was confused by the dynamic. Unsure how to greet Lottie, uneasy about how to greet her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Kev.” She saw him relax at her friendliness.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Nattie. It’s good to see ya.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie closed the door behind him, shutting out the rain. “Well come in, Kev. Dinner’s ready.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sat at the table, fingers curled around a sweating glass of water, trying not to bounce her leg under the table. Across from her, Kevyn picked at his food politely, eyes darting between her and Lottie.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was the picture of composure, almost glowing in the golden kitchen light. She served Kevyn roasted vegetables and rice, complimented the band patches on his jacket, even asked him about Spanish class, which she knew he shared with Nat.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uh, it’s alright.” He laughed. “It’s pretty fuckin stupid actually.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie tensed at the expletive. She kicked him under the table. “What dude?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her “It’s ok Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re not supposed to cuss at the table Kev.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Be nice to the guest Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“She nodded. Sorry Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn looked from one to the other. “Uh, sorry?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie picked up the conversation again as Nat watched in a surreal haze. It seemed impossible to her to have the two of them sharing a space. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn glanced at her. “You okay, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She nodded too quickly. “Yeah. Just tired.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled softly at her. “She was a big help today.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie froze. Kevyn looked curious. “Help how?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Math,” Lottie said, taking a bite. “She’s a natural.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie stared at her plate, the room suddenly too warm. She felt a coolness on her forehead and a light sweat broke. She felt the intense tension of her two lives grinding against each other, past and present colliding.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn chewed slowly, his eyes still flicking back to Natalie. He swallowed. “So… this is where you’ve been?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie hesitated, her fork hovering over her plate. “Yeah.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“All week?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie answered for her, calm and even. “Yes. She asked to stay.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn looked at her, brow creasing slightly. “Your mom cool with that?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shrugged. “She doesn’t really care.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know dude. She let me go in your room and she usually just tells me to leave.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m going over there to get some stuff tomorrow. I’ll tell her I’m staying here.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn nodded slowly, still studying her. “It’s just… I don’t know. Kinda weird, Nat. To stay at this random girl’s house.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie folded her hands neatly on the table. “Maybe she needed a break. A change.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt that comment land on her. She glanced at Lottie, who met her eyes. The words had been met for her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn sat back in his chair. “Still weird.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s not weird Kev.” His persistence annoyed her more than ever. “And she’s not </span>
    <em>
      <span>random</span>
    </em>
    <span>. She’s my teammate. You just don’t know her.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah but you never hung out before.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So?” Lottie gave her a warning glare. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Good behavior. No fights.</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So it’s weird.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie turned to Kevyn, her tone soft but probing. “Were you close? You and Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn looked confused. “We’re best friends.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That wasn’t what I asked.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>He blinked. “I mean, yeah. Maybe more than friends, once.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shot a look at him. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Shut the fuck up.</span>
    </em>
    <span> “He tried to kiss me </span>
    <em>
      <span>one time</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie interjected again. “Then I assume you want what’s best for her.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn sat back slightly, defensive now. “Um, yeah? But like, I don’t think this is it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Maybe she does.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat saw Lottie giving Kevyn a strong glare and her breath caught.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn looked back to Natalie, apparently unaffected. “You like staying here, with this stuck up bitch?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt rage boiling under her skin. Lottie looked at her again, subduing her. She looked back to Kevyn. “Please don’t call her that.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Whatever dude.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>A few beats passed in silence, then Lottie began again. “She’s really smart, you know? She walked me through a calc unit this morning like she’s been doing it her whole life.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn blinked. “I didn’t know you liked math, dude.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shifted in her seat. “Me neither.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you…” he looked between them again. “Are you happy?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, Kev. Thanks for asking.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok. I guess just call me sometimes. I miss hangin.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure, Kev.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then Lottie stood. “Do you want to have a smoke, Kev? We usually have a cigarette or two after dinner.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>He looked surprised. “Uh… sure.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie watched as Lottie stood and started for the back patio.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Kevyn turned to her in a low voice. “Nat… is everything okay with her?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah it’s fine Kev.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Just seems a little… intense here.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked at her hands. “It is.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After the smoke Lottie showed Kevyn to the door. “Good night Kev. It’s was nice having you. Feel free to call Nat here any time.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uh, thanks. Good night Nattie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Night Kev”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The door clicked shut behind Kevyn, and the silence that followed was loud. The house seemed to exhale, like it had been holding tension in its walls.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie sat on her divan, shoulders tense, eyes still fixed on her hands. Lottie walked over to her slowly, her movements smooth and unhurried. She didn’t speak at first. She just sat next to her and waited.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt the urge to explain herself. “I didn’t like the way he talked to you… calling you a bitch. I’m sorry I got mad.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie’s voice was calm. “I told you to be on good behavior. To not fight with him.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie got defensive. “But I </span>
    <em>
      <span>didn’t</span>
    </em>
    <span> fight him.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You told me you were mine,” Lottie said. “You say you trust me. But when the moment came, you couldn’t control yourself. You </span>
    <em>
      <span>wanted</span>
    </em>
    <span> to fight him.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s stomach sank.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You know it’s not your role, don’t you? You don’t need to, you know, defend my honor in a fit of rage.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat kept her gaze downcast. Lottie’s admonishments weighed on her. “Yes Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie reached over and took Natalie’s jaw, turning her chin up so their eyes met.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“But for the most part, you were good.” she said gently. “You let me lead. You were soft. Obedient.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“But then you got defensive. You tried to </span>
    <em>
      <span>correct</span>
    </em>
    <span> the dynamic. That’s not your place, baby.” She put Natalie’s chin back so that she was facing forward again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m sorry. I got confused. He’s so stupid I just had to…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie interrupted her. “You don’t have to explain. You just have to learn better behavior.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie swallowed hard.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m still proud of you. You were brave.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I want you to tell me, Natalie. Before he made you mad, how did it feel? Having the two of us in the same room?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s chest tightened. “It felt wrong, Lot. I thought I was going to split in half. It was weird, like I was two people."</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well you can’t be two people.” Lottie said it simply. “One of them is going to have to disappear.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie turned to her again. “Which one?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie tilted her head. “Which one do you want to disappear?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie didn’t answer. Her throat felt thick.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie reached for her hand. “You can think about it. I’m not asking you to choose tonight.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Natalie’s knuckles. “But I am going to help you see more clearly. And that starts with discipline.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s breath caught. “Now?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled. “Did you think obedience only mattered when someone was watching?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie shook her head. “No, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good. Get undressed. Go up to the bedroom and take your first position. I’ll be right up.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie rose without question and went up to their room. She peeled off her clothes slowly, letting the weight of Lottie’s disappointment coarse through her veins. She felt the quietness of the room, like static electricity waiting to discharge in a bolt of lightning.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She positioned herself facing the headboard and waited.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>A long time passed before she finally heard Lottie enter the room. She didn’t speak for some moment, only circled her, inspected her. She heard her go into the closet and emerge again. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Now I’m going to be nice, and I’m not going to use the buckle… because you tried to be good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie almost choked. “Thank you Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re going to hold still while I talk to you. And if you move, I’ll start over.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie exhaled, her face pressed to the duvet, her arms at her sides. She could feel the air on her skin, the vulnerability of the position amplifying everything else. Her whole body tingled with anticipation, shame, reverence.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie let the belt fall heavy in her hand — not striking, just letting the weight of it be known. The soft leather hissed as it slid through her fingers.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie’s voice came calmly. “You’re being punished because you broke my trust.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie flinched at the words more than she would’ve at the strike. “I didn’t mean to—”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>CRACK.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The first slap of the belt landed across her ass, sharp and precise. Natalie gasped and bit down on the sheets to keep from crying out.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You don’t speak.” Lottie maintained her cool. “You listen.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded into the bedspread. Her breathing came shallow now, every muscle tight.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie let the silence stretch again. She walked slowly behind her, letting the belt drag softly along the backs of Natalie’s thighs.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You spoke out of turn.” Lottie continued. “You escalated a conversation I was in control of. You inserted your feelings when I needed your obedience.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>CRACK.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Another strike, lower this time. Natalie jerked but stayed in place.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m not punishing you because I’m angry,” Lottie said. “I’m punishing you because I know what you really want.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Another pause. Then </span>
    <em>
      <span>CRACK.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie’s knees trembled.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You want to be better for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>CRACK.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You want someone to take all that chaos in your head” she ran her hand up the curve of Natalie’s spine, deceptively gentle, “and shape it into something beautiful. Something that belongs to me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>CRACK.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie whimpered into the bedding, the pain blooming across her skin in radiant streaks. She felt hot, raw, dizzy. But she didn’t move. She didn’t speak. She </span>
    <em>
      <span>took</span>
    </em>
    <span> it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie leaned down, her mouth close to Natalie’s ear. “You did well with Kevyn. You didn’t lie. You didn’t run.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie let out a shuddering breath. Her knees wobbled but held.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You only faltered when you forgot who you serve.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>One final strike, dead center, landed across both cheeks. Natalie cried out this time, unable to hold it back. But still, she didn’t move.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then silence.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She felt the bed shift slightly as Lottie stepped onto it, kneeling behind her. Gentle fingers ghosted over the red, tender skin of her ass, tracing the welts like a painter admiring her brushstrokes.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You did so well, baby.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie turned her head just enough to whisper: “Thank you Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome, Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She felt Lottie take her legs and ease her knees from under her, lowering her slowly. A kiss pressed to her lower back. Then another, lower, and another, a cooling balm.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You can rest now. But tomorrow, when we go out, you’ll show me how much you remember.”</span>
