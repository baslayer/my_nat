  <p>When the alarm rang on Friday morning, Nat woke up in Lottie’s arms. She made an effort to not wake Lottie and gently eased herself free. She decided it was best to leave Lottie to handle the alarm clock herself. Out of bed, she grabbed her bag and went into the bathroom to clean herself and prepare for her run. She found a rhythm she was now accustomed to.</p>

  <p>She came out of the bathroom to see Lottie still in bed, curled into a ball holding a pillow in her place. Nat went to her side of the bed and kneeled so they were face to face.</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Lottie </em>,” she whispered. “Lottie I’m going for a run, do you want to come?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie groaned at her. “Groan twice if you want me leave you alone”</p>
  
  <p>“Leave me alone.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat kissed her and did as she was told.</p>
  
  <p>As she ran, she willed herself not to dwell on the events of the night before. There was a lot to think about, and she wanted to allow the run to clear her head. She ran for longer than usual because she found herself in a part of town she wasn’t familiar with. She focused on mapping a new route for a loop based at the Matthews Estate, one that she hoped to run many times. </p>
  
  <p>When she got back she found Lottie in her room getting ready, already showered and almost fully dressed. “Good morning Natalie. How was your run?”</p>
  
  <p>“It was good, thanks.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you for not touching the alarm.” Lottie gave Natalie a side eye.</p>
  
  <p>“Anything for you, my queen.” Nat said it sarcastically, but felt it hang in the air after it passed over her lips.</p>
  
  <p>Nat showered and dressed quickly, and was ready before Lottie had finished at her vanity. Nat sat at her desk and waited for her.</p>
  
  <p>When they made their way down to the kitchen, Lottie let her choose what she’d have for breakfast. When she asked for toast, Lottie made enough for both of them. As they ate, Lottie looked at her watch. “We should leave in a half an hour.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok. What do we do until then?”</p>
  
  <p>“Check to make sure you have everything that you’re going to need for the day.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat rose and went up to Lottie’s room. She looked at her <em> Done </em> folder and looked over the assignments she’d be handing in, packed her soccer sloths in her backpack, and closed it with a satisfying <em> zip. </em> She turned around and saw Lottie still organizing and packing. Nat sat at her desk and waited for her.</p>
  
  <p>“Are you ready to go?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat perked up, “Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>At school, Nat followed Lottie to homeroom. When they arrived she sat down at her desk and pulled out her <em> To Do </em> folder. To her surprise, she found no packets or worksheets and only one thing remaining on her list. It was an essay for world history comparing Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. <em> I’ll need to go to the library to do that one. No point in starting it here. </em></p>
  
  <p>She took out her<em> Poe </em> book and started reading through the story they had begun to read in class, getting ahead of the pace Mr. O’Neill had set. </p>
  
  <p>When class began she held her focus and took notes and tried not to stare at Lottie. <em> She looks so perfect today.  </em></p>
  
  <p>When class ended, Lottie retrieved Natalie from her seat and offered to walk her to her next class. “Yes, please.” Nat leaned up to kiss her, and Lottie met her half way. Nat walked a step behind her and when they arrived at the math classroom, Lottie turned and kissed Nat on the forehead. “Don’t forget to look over your notes from last class before the lecture starts.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>Nat turned and entered the room with the feeling of the snapping tether. Inside, Van was at the desk she had taken on Wednesday, with her bag in the seat in front of her to save it for Nat. </p>
  
  <p>“Good morning Natalie. How are things?” Van played at formalities. </p>
  
  <p>Nat took the bag from the seat and put it down on Van’s desk. “Things are… good” Nat was slow to answer, still reorienting herself after parting with Lottie. </p>
  
  <p>Van watched as Nat went into her backpack, took out a folder with the word “Done” written in feminine print on the front, retrieved some papers, and then handed them in. Nat put the folder away, took out her notebook, and started reading her notes. </p>
  
  <p>“What, too good for a little friendly conversation before class?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat turned around to look at her, and asked, confused, “what?”</p>
  
  <p>“Dude, why are you reading over your notes?”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, uh, I don’t know. Lottie told me I should review my notes before class.”</p>
  
  <p>“<em> What the fuck?” </em></p>
  
  <p>“What?”</p>
  
  <p>“Why is Lottie telling you to do shit?”</p>
  
  <p>“She’s not… she just wanted to remind me. She’s right, though. Like, it’ll help.”</p>
  
  <p>“What is going <em> on </em> ? I know I’m supposed to be happy and, like, supportive and shit of you getting your shit together but… who <em> are </em> you? We’ve been blowing off math class since freshman year.”</p>
  
  <p>“Maybe I just like math now.”</p>
  
  <p>“Am I on Candid Camera?” Van looked around dramatically. “Am I going to meet Suzanne Somers?”</p>
  
  <p>“Shut up dude, I really do.”</p>
  
  <p>“Did Lottie tell you that you like math now?”</p>
  
  <p>“No… well… maybe. I don’t know, I <em> do </em> like it. Lottie bought me this book and I just like, really like reading it. I like doing the exercises. It feels good. I get why they call it exercises… It’s like I’m running, but it’s my head.”</p>
  
  <p>Van sat agape. “Well, I’m speechless. I hate to break it to you, but you’ve been body snatched. You are a pod person.”</p>
  
  <p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
  
  <p>Van pointed at her. “Exactly what a pod person would say.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat stuck out her tongue. “Fine. See?” She put her notebook down and turned back to Van. “Look, I’m <em> not </em> going to review my notes.”</p>
  
  <p>“There you go. See, was that so hard?”</p>
  
  <p><em> Kind of </em>. “Nope.”</p>
  
  <p>“So what else is new?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat searched for something to talk about besides Lottie. Van had made her self-conscious, and she didn’t want to give her more material to be critical of. “Uh, not much. What’s new with you?” </p>
  
  <p>“I found a record player and amp sitting out for trash this morning. I was gonna bring them back to life and hook them up to my speakers. You want to come by this weekend? You can cheer me on and we could listen to records <em> when </em> I fix them up. It’ll be fun. I missed you… we didn’t hang out all summer.”</p>
  
  <p><em> I’ll ask Lottie. </em> “Yeah that sounds cool. I’ll let you know.”</p>
  
  <p>“I swear to God Nat, if you ask Lottie, I’m calling the police.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat’s face turned red. “Shut up, dude. I don’t know what we’re doing this weekend. I gotta ask her.”</p>
  
  <p>“OH MY GOD No! You <em> tell </em> her. It was hard hearing you got all <em> hooked on drugs </em> and shit but this is like, almost worse.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at her seriously. “Wow, dude.” </p>
  
  <p>“Sorry, I mean like, I’m sorry I didn’t mean that.”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m going to read my notes now.”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m sorry dude. Please come hang. I’ll be working on it tomorrow.”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s fine. Yeah, maybe.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat pushed the exchange out of her head and focused on the notes in front of her. When the lecture started, she paid close attention and followed along. When the teacher gave them practice problems to complete over the second half of class, she did them and offered her help to Van. </p>
  
  <p>Van noted that Nat really was getting good at math, especially when she saw the teacher hand back her unit circle quiz with <em> 100 </em> circled in the corner. “Good job, Nat.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thanks Van”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Nat went to lunch detention and handed in her slip for the fourth and she hoped for the last time. She sat on the bleachers and watched the clock. <em> Three hours until practice. </em></p>
  
  <p>In Computers they had free time, so Nat took out a completed essay from her <em> Doing </em> folder, typed it up, saved it to a floppy disk (per the assignment’s instructructions) and handed it in. It wasn’t technically due as make-up work until Monday, but she was happy to have it done ahead of time. </p>
  
  <p>In Science she worked with Misty on the worksheets instead of waiting for her to do them and then copying her. They finished with time to spare, and when Misty pulled out homework for another class, Nat kept her eyes on the clock. She thought of the hands like they were traversing a period about her unit circle. She related the remaining minutes to the degree measures of the long hand. </p>
  
  <p>
    <em> 30 more minutes, 90° </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em> 25 minutes, 60°… </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>When the bell rang, she went into the hall and started looking for Lottie. <em> I need to learn her schedule </em>. Nat wanted to know where she was.</p>
  
  <p>She found Lottie walking with Laura Lee toward the gym. “Hey Lot.” She was beaming.</p>
  
  <p>“Hi Natalie. You look happy.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah, uh, I’m you know…” Nat looked at Laura Lee. “... happy I found you.”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m happy you found me, too.”</p>
  
  <p>“Well aren’t you two sweet.” Laura Lee pouted in a genuine expression of affection. “You know Natalie, Lottie’s been talking about you a lot.” She elbowed Lottie and smiled, half-teasing her.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh come on, Lee, you’re going to scare her away.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at her. “Impossible.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Out on the field, Nat stayed by Lottie during stretches. Van watched her. “So Nat, did you decide if you’re going to come by tomorrow?” </p>
  
  <p>Nat resisted the urge to turn to Lottie and silently consult her before answering. “Yeah, I mean, I think so.”</p>
  
  <p>“Cool, see you tomorrow. I’m thinkin I’ll get started around noon”</p>
  
  <p>“Cool.”</p>
  
  <p>After tryouts Nat waited for Lottie at her car. She sat on the asphalt on the side opposite the field, so Van wouldn’t see her there. </p>
  
  <p>Lottie walked up with Laura Lee. “Hey Nat, are you hiding?”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, uh… no? I was just… um.” She looked up at Lottie and then looked over to Laura Lee, silently pleading for her to drop it in her presence.</p>
  
  <p>“You ready for burgers, Nat? Lee is going to ride with us.”</p>
  
  <p>“Burgers? With everyone?” </p>
  
  <p>“Yes Natalie, of course.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.” </p>
  
  <p>Lottie bent to kiss her forehead. “Sit in the back, please. Let’s be polite and give our guest the front seat.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>As they rode, Nat sat quietly and listened to Lottie chat with her friend. Laura Lee was talking about church and a boy she thought was cute. Lottie was being supportive and encouraging her. <em> Lottie’s such a good friend. </em></p>
  
  <p>At the diner, the team pushed three tables together. Nat waited for Lottie to pick a seat, and then chose the seat next to her. She took her hand in hers for comfort.</p>
  
  <p>Jackie started in on the questioning. “So Nat, last Friday Lottie said you were coming and then you ditched her. This Friday you’re holding hands under the table.” She put her hands together in front of her, fingers splayed, tapping at the tips. “What changed?”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, uh, well last Friday was kind of a crazy day.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh yeah?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah.”</p>
  
  <p>“What happened?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie glared at Jackie. “She doesn’t want to talk about it.”</p>
  
  <p>Shauna chimed in. “Oh doesn’t she?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at Lottie. “No, I don’t.”</p>
  
  <p>“What’s wrong, Nat? Lot got your tongue?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat smirked at her and put her tongue in her cheek, and answered with smooth innuendo. “Well maybe she did.” </p>
  
  <p>“Natalie!” Lottie turned red and laughed at her. The others watched them, and slowly put the joke together.</p>
  
  <p>Van laughed. “You kind of set her up there Shauna.”</p>
  
  <p>“You guys are fucking gross.”</p>
  
  <p>Jackie circled back. “So is that it, then? You guys are tongue fucking eachother so now Natalie comes to burger night?” </p>
  
  <p>Lottie nodded. “Pretty much.”</p>
  
  <p>“Well jesus christ, you just told me you guys <em> weren’t </em> fucking on Tuesday.”</p>
  
  <p>“Jackie, <em> shut up. </em>” Nat could tell from the tone in Lottie’s voice she was starting to stress out. </p>
  
  <p>“So, uh, Van. What’s up with this setup you’re gonna fix up?” She tried to change the subject.</p>
  
  <p>Van played along for her friend. “It’s going to be awesome dude. It’s a Pioneer SX paired with a Technics SL-1200. Probably some idiot just dropped it when the plug went bad. Looks like it’s in great shape. Gonna be a Japanese Dream when it sings.”</p>
  
  <p>“Are you guys gonna work on it tomorrow?” Lottie looked at Nat.</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah, Van invited me to go to her place. It’s been a while since we’ve hung out so…”</p>
  
  <p>“Sounds like fun.” Lottie smiled at her.</p>
  
  <p>“You’re right, Lottie. It <em> will </em> be fun. Thank you. See Nat? I told you she’d say yes.”</p>
  
  <p>Laura Lee chimed in “Ok guys, let’s be nice. Our friends are happy and we should be happy for them.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thanks Lee.” </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>After the diner, Lottie and Nat dropped Laura Lee off at her house. “Thanks guys! Lottie, call me if you want to come to Church on Sunday! Or you can just call me.” She smiled at Nat. “Bye Nat”</p>
  
  <p>“Bye Laura Lee.”</p>
  
  <p>As they drove, Nat turned her attention to Lottie. “I don’t have to go to Van’s tomorrow.”</p>
  
  <p>“Why wouldn’t you? Sounds like fun.”</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t know… I was kind of hoping we would do stuff this weekend.”</p>
  
  <p>“We can still do stuff, too, Nat. But I think Van missed you. The whole team missed you but I think she was the most worried when you didn’t show.”</p>
  
  <p>“What do you mean, worried?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie hesitated. “Well… there were kind of rumors spreading around about what you were getting into with Kevyn and his cousin. Then you didn’t show up to school or soccer. No one heard from you for like, two months.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah.”</p>
  
  <p>“So… um… what did they say?”</p>
  
  <p>“Nat, I don’t really want to repeat it. It’s just stupid rumors.”</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Lottie </em>. What were they saying about me?”</p>
  
  <p>“People were kind of, like, implying that you were fucking Kevyn and his cousin… like, for drugs.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat was silent.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m sorry Nat. I didn’t mean to…”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Some minutes passed in silence.</p>
  
  <p>“Look, then you called me that night… I thought something had <em> happened </em> to you. I was so scared. Nothing <em> happened </em>, right, Nat? It’s just what you said? You did too much?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.” Lottie bit her lip. “You know you can tell me, Nat. If something did happen.”</p>
  
  <p>“I never fucked Kevyn.”</p>
  
  <p>“No… I know. But like, you know what I’m saying.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Lottie pulled up to Nat’s and Nat went inside to pack more of her things for the weekend. She found her mother in her place on the couch. As she left with a bag of clothes, she told her mom, “I’m staying over at Lottie’s this weekend,” and left.</p>
  
  <p>At Lottie’s house, Nat went in silence up to her room and immediately got in the shower. Under the spray she reflected on what Lottie had said and weighed it against the conversation she’d had with Van in trig. She thought about the girls on the team gossiping about her, first that she was some kind of coke whore for Kevyn, now that she’s obsessed with Lottie. <em> Don’t they have their own fucking lives to worry about? </em></p>
  
  <p>She cleaned herself and thought about the possibilities of a weekend spent with Lottie. She thought of their last Sunday together. <em>Maybe we can have brunch and watch a movie</em>. She smiled at the thought of building a tradition with her. <em>So what if I’m obsessed with her? She’s fucking amazing.</em></p>
  
  <p>When she emerged she found Lottie sitting on her bed, reading. She joined her on the bed. “Hey Lot.”</p>
  
  <p>“Do you feel better?”</p>
  
  <p>“A little bit, thank you.”</p>
  
  <p>“What would you like to do now? It’s a little early to go to bed.”</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t care. You can keep reading. I’m good here.” She curled up into Lottie.</p>
  
  <p>“Do you want me to read to you?”</p>
  
  <p>“Sure. What’re you reading?”</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Bridge to Terabithia </em>”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie read to Nat.</p>
  
  <p>
    <em> “This is not an ordinary place,” she whispered. </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em> Jess looked around at the dry brown ground and the old trees, with gnarled roots and thick, twisted branches. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But Leslie’s voice was low and certain. </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em> “It’s a magic place. We’re the only ones who know it’s here…” </em>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Nat woke up in the morning in Lottie’s arms. She laid and waited until the taller girl stirred. “Good morning Lottie”</p>
  
  <p>“Good morning Natalie. How did you sleep?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat turned to face Lottie “Good.” She paused and looked at her closely. “You’re really pretty.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie blushed and buried her face in her pillow. “Nat stop I just woke up”</p>
  
  <p>Nat started peppering kisses over her. “Make me”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie turned her head and kissed her back. Nat smiled and deepened it quickly from her position above her. She moved to kiss down Lottie’s neck as she moved herself to be completely over her. “It’s nice waking up next to you without an alarm.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh? You don’t like my alarm?”</p>
  
  <p>“Hate it.”</p>
  
  <p>“Too bad.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat laughed at her. “Whatever you say, Lot.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled and stroked her hair. “That’s a good girl. You know what I say now?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked up at her. “What?”</p>
  
  <p>“I think it’s time to get out of bed.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie whimpered. “Are you sure?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah, let’s go for a run.”</p>
