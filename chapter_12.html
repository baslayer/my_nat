<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, Nat realized she was looking forward to going to school. Lottie joined her for her run, she executed her morning routine, and she ate breakfast at the table and talked about the coming day. She was nearly caught up, ahead in English and Trig, and had no lunch detention. When she shared the outlook of her day with Lottie, she received praise for her good work.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome Natalie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They were ready ahead of schedule, so Nat sat and did exercises from her trig textbook while Lottie played piano. When she announced it was time to leave, Natalie followed Lottie out the door to her car.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good morning, ladies” Mr. Colburn greeted them when they arrived at school.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie read from the &lt;em&gt; Poe &lt;/em&gt; book while Lottie worked with Mr. O’Neill to prepare for class. She finished &lt;em&gt; The Tell Tale Heart &lt;/em&gt;, even though the class wasn’t scheduled to finish it until the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In trig, Mrs. Fuller called Natalie to her desk before class began.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good morning, Natalie. How was your weekend?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It was good, thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s good. I wanted to talk to you about your make-up work.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was in a good mood but the disdain she felt towards the teacher last week began to boil under skin. &lt;em&gt; What now? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to tell you how impressed I am with your work. You came to class after missing two weeks, and in one week you’ve caught up to and maybe even surpassed the rest of the class.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Fuller didn’t know that Nat had a book at home and had been working through the sections independently. Not only was she ahead in concepts, but she was working problems at the college level. The worksheets that were sent home were comparatively a breeze, and the in-class assignments that came after lecture were rudimentary.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did you find a tutor?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, Mrs. Fuller.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well, then I am all the more impressed. Now, as I told you last week, you were very far behind and the work you’ve submitted thus far has been subject to a significant penalty. If you would consider coming to the after-school help hour and make yourself available as a tutor to your classmates, I would be happy to waive the penalty on your work. What do you think?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;Lottie will think this is good.&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“When is the help hour? I have soccer after school.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“The help hour opens immediately after the last bell and as the name implies, it lasts one hour. I have had athletes participate before and usually they can make it work. If you are considering it, please talk it over with Coach Martinez. If you attend on Tuesdays and Thursdays for 4 weeks, I will forgive your penalties.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Very good Natalie, thank you. You may take your seat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Nat sat back down she was greeted by Van. “Good morning Nat. Or should I call you Steve Urkel?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat laughed at her. “Shut up, man. What’s up?” She took her notebook out and put it on her desk.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I should be asking you. What’d teach want?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She wants me to tutor at the help hours. She says she’ll give me credit for my missed days.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh shit, dude. That’s awesome. Are you gonna do it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. I kind of want to, but, like, I’ll probably have to miss soccer.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Damn, dude. Well it’s still really early in the season. Maybe coach will let it slide and let you miss part of practice.” Van smiled before she added sarcastically, “It’s for the noble cause of educating the masses on mathematics after all.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat stuck out her tongue at the comment. “You &lt;em&gt; wish &lt;/em&gt; you were good at math.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No I definitely do not. I’m good with my hands, and that’s all a girl needs.” She stuck her tongue in her cheek as she laughed at her own joke.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat shook her head in mocking disapproval. “Speaking of hands, how’s Tai?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;At the mention of her name, Van grew shy and smiled to herself as she blushed. “Um, she’s really great. She, uh, is helping me with college application stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded at her. “Ah, so your &lt;em&gt; girlfriend &lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt; helping &lt;/em&gt; you. Where have I heard that before?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh? Did you say &lt;em&gt; girlfriend &lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was saved by the bell. She just looked at Van and rolled her eyes before turning and facing forward.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When class let out, Nat went back towards Mr. O’Neill’s room to see if she could catch Lottie before third hour. She was looking forward to sharing the news of Mrs. Fuller’s offer with her. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat found Lottie in the hall with Shauna, discussing the upcoming test on their Pygmalion unit.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hi Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Nat” She leaned down to peck her forehead. “What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, uh…” She glanced at Shauna. “nothing, I just wanted to see if I could find you. You said you had AP Lit now and my second hour was right upstairs”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re sweet Nat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We were kind of having a conversation?” Shauna reinserted herself.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked from Shauna to Nat and sighed. “Nat, you’re going to be late. Didn’t you say your third period was in building 1?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but, um... I wanted to talk to you about something.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Let’s talk later, ok? Go to class.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Bye Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat got to Spanish class just before the bell. She saw Kevyn sitting in the back, waved, and then took a seat in the front. When class got out, she tried to leave quick enough to avoid him but he caught up to her. “Hey Nattie, wait up!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What’s up Kev?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nothing dude. What class you got now?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Computers”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Cool. Fuck it. Come hang out.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat gave him a dirty look as she kept walking. “I can’t miss class.” &lt;em&gt; Lottie wouldn’t like it. &lt;/em&gt; “I’m out of absences, remember? Ms. Thew could fail me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You know that bitch don’t give a &lt;em&gt; fuck &lt;/em&gt;. Come on, I didn’t see ya all weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nah, Kev, I’ll pass.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you mad at me again?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Then why not?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Kevyn’s persistence started to grate on her nerves and she became more hostile. “I just told you. Are you fuckin stupid or something?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Shut the fuck up. What’s your problem?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know Kev. Maybe you’re my fuckin problem. I found out people were talking mad shit and I kinda don’t feel like I wanna be seen around you right now.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck? Who told you that?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter dude. I don’t want to hang out.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Fuck you, you dude. I guess it figures… you’re a fuckin’ dyke now so you don’t need me huh?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt her blood boil. She turned around to shove him. “The fuck did you just say?” She yelled it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You heard me. Talk about shit? Everyone is talking about you and your new &lt;em&gt; piece &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt her smallness in that movement. She envisioned herself punching his face but when she realized she was too short to get a good angle on him, she opted for a clean shot between his legs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; Ungh! &lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Don’t fuckin talk to me like that, you fucking loser.” She left him kneeling on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Five minutes after the bell, the official voice of an admin came over the class’s PA, “Hi Ms. Thew, would you please send Natalie Scatorccio to the front office, please”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah I’ll send her down.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat took the hall pass and made her way to the office. &lt;em&gt; Fucking idiot can’t keep his fucking mouth shut. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she got there, the front desk receptionist sent her Mr. Colburn’s office where Kevin was already seated, ice pack on his crotch. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Miss Scatorccio, thank you for joining us.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Not like I had a choice. &lt;/em&gt; “Sure.” She sat down, her arms on the arm rests of the chair, legs uncrossed, and didn’t look at Kevyn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Now as I understand it, you two had a bit of a scuffle in the hall?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Kevyn spoke first, “no she fuckin’ punched me in the balls”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked at Colburn. “What? Aren’t you gonna give him detention for a &lt;em&gt; foul mouth &lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We are here to talk about your behavior, Miss Scatorccio. Mr. Tan has told me you tried to start a fight with him?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She crossed her arms. “He started it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I can’t help but notice that he’s the one who’s injured here.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well, if you have nothing else to say, I will have to write you up again. I am happy to hear your teachers reporting good attendance, so I will not go directly to suspension as these matters typically would. Considering you have served out the lunch detentions from last week, I’m inclined to believe you’ll serve these out reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He handed her a yellow slip. &lt;em&gt; Lunch detention 9/11-9/13 &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“If you do not serve these, I will go back to one-week suspension. Is that clear?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok Miss Scatorccio. Is there anything you’d like to say to your friend?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I think you owe him an apology.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat saw red at the edges of her vision. She felt the urge to look over at Kevyn but stopped herself and tried to manage her reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Through gritted teeth she said without an ounce of sincerity, “Sorry Kev.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Very good Miss Scatorccio, thank you.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie rose and left without looking at Kevyn. When she got to class she tried to calm herself down but failed. When the bell rang she groaned at the thought of having to go to detention &lt;em&gt; again &lt;/em&gt;. She wanted badly to find Lottie and feel the relief she offered and considered skipping the detention to find her during lunch. She quickly decided against it though, considering she’d have to tell Lottie about what had happened anyway, and Lottie wouldn’t approve of her skipping at the risk of getting suspended.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat checked her slip and found the location was changed this week, &lt;em&gt; Library &lt;/em&gt;. When she arrived she found the same nameless teacher as before. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Back for more, huh?” He marked her slip.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She found a seat at a table and sat with her head down.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat groaned and sat up. She did her best to take her mind off the confrontation with Kevyn and tried to focus on the weekend she’d had. She replayed the afternoon with Van, and her Sunday with Lottie. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She thought of the beautiful library and looked around at her surroundings. This library was humble and unpretentious, but she found that she felt a new appreciation for its essence. It was like a small kitten compared to a fierce lion. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She felt herself relax at the idea that her punishment was to spend time in a library. She looked for a clock but couldn’t see one from where she sat, so she craned her neck and stared at the ceiling tiles, imagining them blank canvases on which beautiful murals could be painted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When the bell rang she made her way to health class and waited patiently for Lottie. She arrived soon after Nat, Tai and Van trailing behind her. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van put her hand on Lottie’s shoulder. “See Lot? I told you she’d be here. Nothing to worry about.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie smiled at her before sitting down and kissing Nat on the cheek. “I thought you’d come to lunch today.” Nat heard the disappointment in her voice. There was not a trace of lightness.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I uh, I got detention again. Til Wednesday.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her sternly. “What happened?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really want to talk about it right now.” Nat lamented not being in the mood to talk about Mrs. Fuller’s offer to have her tutor, either. “I’m happy to see you, though.” She looked at Lottie and felt soothed. Her shoulders relaxed and she broke a smile, the first since she’d left math class and found Lottie in the hall.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you think I could have your schedule?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know… uh, sometimes I want to, you know, find you. Is that ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie smiled at her. “If I give it to you, do you promise to tell me how you got detention again?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I was gonna tell you anyway, Lot. I just don’t feel good right now.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie nodded. “If I give it to you, do you promise it’ll make you feel better?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat smiled at her again “Totally.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie kissed her forehead. “Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She took out a notecard and wrote in perfect script, &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; To My Natalie, so you know where to find me: &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;♡&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP World History 2-108&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP Lit 2-104&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP Anatomy &amp;amp; Physiology 2-211&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;♡&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP Calc 2-205&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP French 1-201&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie took the notecard and studied it, committing it to memory. “Thanks Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day went smoothly for Nat. The more she thought about her fight with Kevyn, the less she cared. She decided she was at least relieved to have a good reason to not want to hang out with him, and would therefore not need to entertain invitations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After her last period, she met Lottie in the locker room and changed for practice with her team. Before heading out onto the field, she found coach in his office so she could talk to him about the help hour.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s very good Natalie. I’ll work with you. What time is the study hour?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s right after class and it’s an hour so…” Nat thought about it. “Probably like 2:30-3:30?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s just fine. Practice starts at 3:15 so if you can get here by 3:45 that’s fine as long as you’re getting your running in. It may be a different story when the games start up but for now it should be ok. Thank you for asking.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thanks coach.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy to see you succeeding in your classes. I think you’re ready to move up from tryouts. Do you think so?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes coach.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok see you out there. Keep up the good work.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She nodded and went out to the field. She joined her team on the field and shared the good news.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Finally!” Jackie gave her a hug. “Glad to have you back on the squad, Nattie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good job, dude”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yay, Natalie!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The team’s congratulations heartened her. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After practice she went with Lottie to her car. Nat’s mood had fully turned around from the energy of her first real practice and she was eager to share her news.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“How was the rest of your day, Lot?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It was alright. We had a quiz in Calc and it was a pain. Then in French Jackie would not shut up about how &lt;em&gt; great &lt;/em&gt; Jeff is. Sometimes I think she’s trying to convince herself more than she’s trying to convince me.” Nat nodded in understanding. “How was the rest of your day?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, it was good. Boring. I told DeMartino I needed more time to research for the essay and he told me I had til Friday, so that should be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie mimed like she was writing something down on the inside of her hand and smiled at Nat. “Noted” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt the quiet warmth of being looked after.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;As they rode, Lottie began again. “So are you feeling good enough to tell me why you have detention again.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded. “Yeah… I guess I’m kinda over it now. I got into a fight with Kevyn in the hall after Spanish and he tattled on me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Natalie.” Lottie was frowning. “Why did you want to fight him?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t even really a fight. I just got him square in the balls.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok… why did you want to hit him?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie hesitated. She hadn’t dwelled on the part of the confrontation that had been about Lottie, but rather that Kevyn had been lame enough to snitch. “Does it matter?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Kind of, yeah.” Nat looked at Lottie and saw she still was expressively upset. “Would you please tell me, Nat?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well I kinda told him I didn’t want to hang around him because people had talked shit about it, even though I really just didn’t want to hang because I &lt;em&gt; just didn’t want to &lt;/em&gt; .” Nat felt herself getting angrier as she returned to the place in her memory. “Then he said some bullshit about how people are talking about how I bagged you and he called you a &lt;em&gt; piece &lt;/em&gt; and called me a &lt;em&gt; dyke &lt;/em&gt; and so I got pissed off and hit him.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie was silent.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“And then I got, like, &lt;em&gt;really pissed&lt;/em&gt; when I got called to Colburns office because he ratted me out and Colburn was all like &lt;em&gt; you owe him an apology &lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s ok, it’s not your fault. It just kinda sucked because I was in such a good mood this morning and those assholes fucking &lt;em&gt; ruined &lt;/em&gt; it.” Then she remembered the good news she wanted to share. “Oh shit, Lot! I got something else to tell you.” Her mood flipped instantly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well Mrs. Fuller says she’s impressed with my work so she wants me to help tutor in trig after school. She’s gonna let me make up credit. And I asked coach and he said it’s cool if I’m a little late when I go.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s great Nat.” Lottie smiled at her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nothing. What?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie felt uncertainty wash over her. When she’d imagined telling Lottie about it she had expected... &lt;em&gt;something else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Aren’t you, um… like, proud of me?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course I’m proud.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They sat for a while in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Natalie?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you mad at me?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Then what’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie sighed. “I don’t know Nat. I guess it’s a few things. It was a long day at school, I’m tired, and now I know you got into a fight with Kevyn. He’s not, you know, my favorite person but it still isn’t great you got into a fight. It’s great that Mrs. Fuller thinks you’re doing well but I just can’t bring myself to be &lt;em&gt; happy &lt;/em&gt; right now.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I guess it’s also just, you know, I want &lt;em&gt; you &lt;/em&gt; to be proud of &lt;em&gt; yourself &lt;/em&gt;. Of course I’m proud of you but, I’m not the one you have to make happy. You should make yourself happy.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat considered what she said. “But… I like making you happy. Making you happy makes me happy. I was proud of it but… my first thought was to tell you. You’ve helped me so much. I… ”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie interrupted her. “I know, Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When they got up to the bedroom, Nat took her place at the desk and took out two assignments she’d received that day and completed all of them within an hour. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot, are you done?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, Nat, I still have a lot of studying to do. I have the test I told you about in English tomorrow. Don’t you have your vocab quiz? You should study your flashcards if you have more time.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie studied for a while and when she felt she had the words down, she got up and silently went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. She made pasta with a meat sauce and set the table. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she returned upstairs she found Lottie had put away her work and neatened up the desk where Nat had been working. She was lying on her bed, curled up on her side.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat got onto the bed and big-spooned her. “I’m sorry Lot”. She felt Lottie sigh. “I made us dinner. Please come and have dinner with me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie took a moment and then turned around to kiss Nat. “Ok Nat. Let’s eat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;As they smoked, Lottie suggested Nat go home and spend the night at her place. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want me here?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course I do, Natalie. I love being here with you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I love being here with you, too. Why do I have to go home?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s your home.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“If you say so.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
