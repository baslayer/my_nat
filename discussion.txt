On Pygmalion (Ovid):

1. The Sculptor and the Muse
Pygmalion: A sculptor creates a statue according to his ideal of a perfect woman. It is inert until the gods bring it to life, making her both real and fully his.

Natalie and Lottie: Lottie does not literally create Natalie’s body, but she carefully molds Natalie’s behavior, thought patterns, and self-perception to match what she believes is “right” for her. Natalie moves from independence (even if chaotic) to obedient stillness.

Where Pygmalion idealizes passive beauty, Lottie idealizes controlled calm.

2. Consent and Agency
Pygmalion: The statue has no agency until it’s brought to life, and even then, the story doesn’t focus on her independent will.

Natalie and Lottie: Natalie is shaped actively but retains self-awareness. Even after realizing “the thing” Lottie did, Natalie reaffirms her choice. Her agency is convoluted. She consents after being shaped.

That ambiguity creates more tension in your story than in Ovid, where the statue simply fulfills the sculptor’s dream.

3. Emotional Stakes
Pygmalion: The transformation is framed as beautiful and romantic, with divine approval. It’s a reward for devotion.

This Story: There’s emotional ambivalence. Natalie experiences relief and peace, but characters like Van provide an outside perspective questioning what’s really good or healthy.

The relationship in this story carries more psychological realism. It acknowledges the cost of devotion.

4. Symbolism: The Still Point
Pygmalion’s statue becomes real and warm under the sculptor’s touch.

Natalie finds her “still point” through Lottie’s guidance: controlled, quiet, reshaped not physically but mentally and emotionally.

Both characters become what their shaper intended: statuesque in calmness or purpose. But in this story the shaped person gets to reflect on and speak about that state.

On addiction:

This idea kind of acts as the psychological and thematic spine of the Story: Natalie’s dynamic with Lottie is not framed as an isolated loss of control, but as a replacement for a destructive form of control she’d already surrendered to.

1. Control as Relief vs. Chaos
Before Lottie, Natalie isn’t free. She’s in a constant state of flight:

- Fleeing her father’s abuse.

- Fleeing guilt from the moment with her father’s death.

- Fleeing her own mind via drugs, alcohol, risky behavior.

Self-control is absent. Natalie isn’t choosing where she’s going; she’s reacting, driven by trauma and addiction. That’s why the repeated phrasing about her needing to know what to do hits hard. When she says things like:

“It makes it easier.”
It’s not submissive for its own sake. It’s a form of structure she never had.

Lottie’s control offers a structured version of what drugs did for her before:

- Quieting noise.

- Blocking intrusive thoughts.

- Creating a predictable routine.
But with the added layer of emotional intimacy and being seen.

2. Addict Identity and Choice
Addiction, as a theme, is baked into Natalie’s self-concept.
Even in canon, adult Nat wrestles with it explicitly: she identifies purpose as the antidote to addict behaviors. She struggles with cycles of relapse.

The story emphasizes that her “choice” to stay with Lottie isn’t a clean, free-willed decision in the way Van or Kev might want it to be. It’s conditioned by a pre-existing need to surrender autonomy in favor of structure and relief.
To put it plainly: Natalie isn’t looking for freedom, she’s looking for containment.

From the story:

“I don’t want to be like before. I just want to stay like this.”
It’s very close in emotional logic to an addict saying:
“I don’t trust myself not to use. I need someone else to tell me what to do.”
And that’s where the story leans into something darker than a simple love story or power dynamic. It’s about finding a form of stability after a life of instability, even if that stability is conditional or unhealthy viewed from the outside.

3. Philosophical Angle: Surrender and Addiction
From a broader lens, there’s an idea that everyone surrenders to something:

- Addicts surrender to the substance.

- Some people surrender to religion, structure, community.

- Natalie surrenders to Lottie.

But what sets Natalie apart is that she’s aware of it and chooses it knowingly, particularly after the reveal about “the thing” Lottie did to her. It’s not about agency being stripped away. It’s about Natalie recognizing she doesn’t want to pilot her own plane because every time she does, it crashes.

“I just want to stay like this. With you.”

She isn’t saying: “I’m trapped.”
She’s saying: “Please don’t let me loose again.”

On Lottie:
1. Lottie as Both Controlled and Controlling
Before Natalie, Lottie lives a double bind:

She submits to external control to maintain her own sanity: medication, hospitalization, likely therapy.

At the same time, her wealth and family detachment leave her effectively in control of her own environment. She has the house, the car, the power — but nobody present to witness her.

The way you’re writing her, Natalie is the first person Lottie gets to fully control on her own terms. Not as a patient, not as someone “above” her in authority — just as someone she can mold.

That’s a quiet but powerful shift from Lottie’s world as dictated by her parents, doctors, and money.

2. Lottie’s Interest in Natalie Specifically
There’s class dynamic:

Lottie is rich, polished, and socially detached.

Natalie is poor, rough, openly self-destructive.

Lottie choosing Natalie isn’t just about power; it’s also about wanting to connect with something more raw and real than what she’s allowed. Her wealth isolates her. Natalie’s pain makes her tangible and present in a way that quiet wealth can’t offer.

By pulling Natalie in, Lottie isn’t just controlling her. She’s also anchoring herself. Which echoes adult Lottie’s wilderness leader role — gathering people around her to feel less adrift herself.

You also get the sense that Lottie, in both your story and canon, doesn’t trust her own mind fully. But she trusts her ability to order someone else’s.

3. “First Taste” of Control Dynamic
The way Lottie initiates control in your story feels in line with a first experiment that becomes a pattern:

It’s intimate.

It’s done under the guise of care: “I’m helping you.”

Once it works, she keeps doing it because it soothes both of them.

That’s the heart of it: Lottie’s control isn’t framed as sadism. It’s framed as therapy she gets to tailor, unmonitored by doctors or parents. Natalie becomes her personal proof that she can help someone better than anyone ever helped her.

It ties to the show’s wilderness arc cleanly. The cult is essentially Lottie applying that same logic on a larger scale:
“If I control others gently enough, I can keep them safe. And in keeping them safe, I keep myself safe.”

4. Loneliness and the Drive to Lead
You said it yourself: the house is too big, too empty.
That reads like Lottie living with everything except intimacy. What Natalie gives her isn’t just obedience — it’s presence. Someone who sees her, touches her, reacts to her.

The party scene especially highlights this:

Lottie glows in public.

But it’s Natalie she anchors back to.
That dynamic is core to her arc — the public queen, but privately hungry for something smaller and closer.

On Van: 
Here’s a clean list of Van’s relationship to Natalie across the story, in bullet form:

Older friend dynamic:

Van and Nat both live in the same trailer park.

Known each other since at least freshman year.

Shared low-income background, mutual understanding of each other’s rough home lives.

Two years prior (incident with Nat’s father):

Van likely heard or witnessed the aftermath of the shooting.

Chose not to directly address it with Nat, let her process (or avoid processing) in silence.

Passive form of support—being present without confronting.

Summer after junior year (Nat’s drug spiral):

Van saw Nat fall in with Kevyn and his cousin.

Did nothing; focus was on Tai and her own life.

Underlying guilt builds from this period—feels she should have acted.

Start of story (senior year):

Relief that Natalie is back at school and seemingly stable.

Initially reassures herself Natalie has things under control now.

As Natalie falls under Lottie’s influence:

Van notices Natalie withdrawing, becoming quieter, more controlled.

Recognition of similar patterns from before—but now tied to Lottie instead of drugs.

Guilt resurfaces: “Not again.”

At the party (beer pong scene):

First concrete moment Van sees something undeniable: Lottie’s influence happening in real time.

Natalie's hypnotic obedience confirms Van’s suspicions.

Decision point: Van chooses to intervene directly.

Confrontation at Lottie’s house:

Van teams up with Kevyn; more serious now.

Pushes harder than before, trying to get through to Natalie directly.

Realization: it’s already too late. Natalie has fully aligned herself with Lottie.

Final state:

Van leaves Lottie’s house frustrated and powerless.

Emotional arc completes: from passive observer → guilty friend → would-be rescuer → resigned outsider.

Knows she waited too long, but doesn’t fully give up—leaves door open (“You know where to find me.”).

On Kevyn:
Here’s a clean bullet list summarizing Kevyn’s role and motivations:

Kevyn’s dynamic with Natalie:

Has a longstanding crush on Nat, predating Lottie by 2–3 months.

His pursuit is casual and careless, more juvenile than predatory, but still self-centered.

Sees Nat’s vulnerability as an opening, not something to protect.

Introduction of drugs:

Likely first connected at a party or through mutual friends.

Gave Natalie her first experience with harder drugs (likely cocaine).

Not calculated—he’s not trying to ruin her, just pulling her into his world.

Uses the shared experience of partying as a way to keep her around.

Crude mirroring of Lottie’s dynamic:

Like Lottie, Kevyn wants Natalie close and dependent, but without control or care.

Motivated by self-interest rather than healing or nurturing.

His “claim” on Nat is less about control, more about access and shared vice.

Personality contrast:

Kevyn is lazy, aimless, and emotionally clueless.

Less magnetic than Lottie, less intentional—he doesn’t plan, he drifts.

His version of control is passive: being the easy option for Natalie to fall into.

Present-day (during story events):

Natalie’s shift toward Lottie cuts him off, but he doesn’t immediately clock why.

Still views Nat as “his,” even if he doesn’t act on it aggressively.

Teams up with Van when prompted, but doesn’t fully grasp the seriousness.

His comments during the confrontation show moments of accidental insight (“Nat doesn’t like being told what to do”) but he’s not emotionally equipped to intervene meaningfully.

On the team:
Primary Team Motivation:

The team’s top priority is making it to Nationals.

Natalie is critical to this goal; as a skilled midfielder, her absence jeopardizes their chances.

At the start of the story, Natalie has been missing from school and practice for about two weeks, causing real concern within the team.

Initial Reactions to Natalie’s Absence:

Frustration and resignation set in among the team members—without Natalie, their chances are reduced.

Lottie uses this as a key argument when she pulls Natalie back in: "They need you. We need you."

This external need aligns with Lottie’s deeper, more personal motivation to control and take care of Natalie.

The Team’s Response to Natalie’s Return:

When Natalie comes back, the team’s reaction is mixed—half relief, half mockery:

Tai: “Didn’t think you’d come back.”

Jackie: “Who had September 4th?” (treating it like a pool on her return date.)

There’s no real warmth—just pragmatic acknowledgment of her value as a player.

This highlights the contrast between team dynamics and Lottie’s individualized care for Natalie.

Gossip & Reputation:

Lottie later reveals to Natalie that she was a topic of gossip while she was gone.

Speculation centered around her relationship with Kevyn—rumors that she was probably sleeping with him for drugs.

This public perception contributes to Natalie’s isolation, making Lottie’s focused attention feel even more meaningful to her.

The Team as a Moral Counterpoint:

Tai serves as a specific foil:

She doesn’t really care about Natalie beyond what’s necessary to support Van.

Tai views Natalie as a burnout, someone from a lower social and class bracket.

Her moderate interest is only because she’s watching out for Van, not genuine concern for Natalie.

Broader Social Contrast:

The team embodies a kind of social order that Natalie is outside of.

While they rely on her for her skill, they don’t integrate her emotionally.

Their treatment of Natalie highlights why Lottie’s total, consuming attention would feel both seductive and necessary to her.

Functional Role in Plot Structure:

The team’s need for Natalie serves as Lottie’s initial justification for stepping into her life.

Their indifferent and mocking treatment later underscores why Natalie would choose the complete devotion Lottie offers over casual acceptance from her peers.

On d/s dynamic:
Initial Catalyst:

The story introduces physical control before explicitly introducing D/s elements. The first real moment is Lottie pinning Natalie’s wrists down in bed when Natalie resists getting up, folding her hands above her head. This is a moment of both literal and symbolic submission: Natalie doesn’t fully understand why it turns her on, but it does, foreshadowing her desire for someone else to set her limits.

It mirrors the larger arc of Natalie coming under Lottie’s influence: what starts as small choices (going back to practice, writing her essay) grows into full psychological submission.

First Explicit Sexual Induction:

When Lottie uses hypnotic suggestion to make Natalie orgasm, guiding her through a deliberately induced subspace, it deepens both the sexual and emotional stakes. It’s not just sex, it’s about Lottie orchestrating Natalie’s experience so completely that even her body’s responses aren’t her own.

This establishes trust and dependency, which parallels Natalie’s growing dependence on Lottie outside of sex.

Progression and Escalation:

As their relationship develops, the D/s dynamic becomes more layered. It’s not just physical control; it becomes psychological conditioning. For example:

The belting scene where Natalie asks Lottie to punish her and reacts with both arousal and self-loathing. This directly ties to Natalie’s history of abuse—her instinctual craving for structure and limits coming into painful conflict with her fear of being hurt again.

The fully non-sexual conditioning session where Lottie guides Natalie through a series of obedience tasks. This blends their sexual and everyday dynamics, making Natalie’s submission not just about pleasure but about how she exists around Lottie constantly.

Hypnotic Control Expanding:

The scene where Lottie hypnotizes Natalie to control her physical movements, guiding her through mutual masturbation, illustrates the deepening of both trust and power imbalance. Natalie’s body literally becomes an instrument of Lottie’s will.

This marks a key shift from submission being about service or reaction (doing what Lottie says) to submission being about transformation (becoming what Lottie wants her to be).

Anal Play and Further Boundaries:

Lottie introducing anal fingering and bringing Natalie to orgasm through anal penetration is a notable escalation in the physical side of the dynamic. Symbolically, it represents Natalie allowing Lottie full access to her body—holding nothing back, letting herself be fully open in every sense.

It’s important that these acts are consensual and, in Natalie’s mind, wanted. She doesn’t frame it as Lottie taking from her; she frames it as Lottie helping her feel whole and ordered.

Contrast with Non-D/s Encounters:

After the soccer game, they have sex that’s less about control and more about mutual teenage lust. This is a deliberate counterpoint in the narrative: the D/s dynamic isn’t a constant requirement. It’s a core part of their connection, but not their entire relationship.

These moments show that Natalie’s submission is voluntary and situational, not something Lottie imposes constantly. It underscores Natalie’s agency in choosing submission—not as something she’s forced into, but as something that gives her peace.

Emotional Depth Beneath the Power Exchange:

Especially after the "Still Point" chapter, when Natalie learns about Lottie’s mental health struggles, the D/s dynamic takes on new emotional weight. It’s no longer just about Lottie controlling Natalie—it’s about Natalie offering herself as an anchor for Lottie as well.

Their dynamic shifts slightly into something mutual: Lottie provides control and Natalie provides devotion. It’s a closed loop where both feel steadier inside the other’s gravity.

Symbolic Reflections:

The D/s relationship mirrors Natalie’s internal battle between chaos and order:

Before Lottie: drugs, violence, self-destruction.

With Lottie: discipline, routine, purpose.

Lottie becomes both her top and her tether. Submission for Natalie is framed not as a loss of self, but as a form of healing through deliberate surrender.

On her love of math:

Natalie’s baseline state before Lottie:

Distracted, restless, self-destructive tendencies.

No capacity for sustained focus or interest in school or structured activities.

Academic work felt irrelevant compared to the urgency of escaping her own mind through substances or fights.

Introduction of routine and peace through Lottie:

Through submission to Lottie’s routine, Natalie develops calmness and consistency.

Running, dressing, studying, and writing become structured anchors in her day.

This structure creates the mental quiet necessary to notice what she enjoys outside of survival mode.

Discovery of love for math:

Initially, math appears in the story as a subject she’s just “good at.”

As Natalie spends more time working quietly under Lottie’s care, she begins to appreciate its logic and order.

Math provides a mirrored form of peace: the certainty of correct answers, clean processes, and predictable outcomes.

Her trig test sequence shows her deriving quiet satisfaction from solving problems step by step—linked explicitly to her desire to please Lottie, but growing into its own source of gratification.

Personal statement essay as a turning point:

Mr. O’Neill prompts her to write about her future, forcing Natalie to confront the idea of long-term plans.

Lottie guides her but doesn’t write it for her; Natalie ultimately chooses architecture, a form of applied math.

This shows Natalie finding personal ambition: not just doing what Lottie says, but building a future she can articulate herself.

Emotional significance:

Math and logic become metaphors for Natalie’s healing:

Processes with clear rules.

Problems with solvable outcomes.

Control she can exert over small parts of her world.

Without Lottie providing external order first, Natalie wouldn’t have been able to internalize her own form of discipline through math.

Subtext of submission mirrored in problem-solving:

Math requires following steps, showing obedience to formulas—echoing Natalie’s obedience to Lottie.

The difference is: while submission is about surrender, math is about self-guided action.

Through both, Natalie finds peace from the same core thing: trusting in a process larger than her chaotic instincts.
