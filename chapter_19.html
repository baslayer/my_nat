    <p>
        <span>Natalie returned from her run flushed and glowing, her skin damp with sweat, still slightly out of breath. She opened the door to the bedroom and found Lottie seated at her vanity, freshly showered, doing her face.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie's eyes met her through the mirror the moment she heard the door open. She smiled. "Good morning, Natalie." Natalie smiled, still feeling the high of the run. "Good morning, Lottie." She approached her and kissed her cheek.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie inhaled deeply and looked up to her. "You smell… </span>
        <em>
          <span>so good</span>
        </em>
        <span>.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She took her hand, pulled her closer and turned to face her fully, rising slightly in her seat. She brought their mouths together in a sudden, unhesitating kiss. It was deep. Intense.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>As they kissed, Lottie's hand slid  to Natalie's shoulder and she pressed gently.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie sank to her knees without hesitation, eyes fluttering closed as the change in position sent a wave of pleasure through her. Lottie kissed her all the way down, not breaking until the smaller girl had sat. Natalie placed her hands in Lottie's lap and waited.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>"I'm so proud of you." Lottie's voice was warm and sure. She stroked Nat’s hair and looked into her. "You're getting better every day. More beautiful. More obedient."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie kept her gaze fixed and felt the warmth enter her, combining with the gratification of her praise. She felt the potent mixture between her legs. "Thank you Lottie."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie looked down and stroked Natalie's hands in her lap, lingering at her wrist, letting her fingertips trace about its slightness. “I want to give you something."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She turned to take her watch from its place on her vanity, and fastened it carefully on Natalie's wrist. "Wear this for me." </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie looked down at the timepiece on her arm. The leather was soft against her skin. Italian, maybe alligator. The face was rectangular, delicate, with CARTIER written in stately capitals across it. She could almost hear Lottie's voice when she saw it tick. Her heart raced.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>"Do you like it?"</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat glanced down again. The watch felt like a shackle. A beautiful restraint.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>"Yes Lottie. Thank you." She kissed Lottie's hand.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>"You're welcome baby."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She flexed her hand and felt the band shift gently. The leather was warm now, alive with her body heat.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat sat quietly as Lottie drove to school, eyes forward, hands in her lap. She waited for Lottie to kill the engine before unclipping her seatbelt. She didn't reach for the door handle until Lottie did first. After they stepped out the car, Natalie automatically fell in half a step behind and slightly to the side. Lottie didn't say anything as they walked, but occasionally tapped her wrist against Nat's, a silent cue to keep pace. "Good Morning Mr. Colburn" Lottie greeted the admin as she led Natalie through the school entrance.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie glanced at her and smiled. "Chin up, baby."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie obeyed instantly. "Thank you Lottie."</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good morning Lottie! And Natalie! So good to see you.” </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good morning Mr. O’Neill” Lottie tapped Nat’s desk as she passed it. “Did you have a good weekend?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie took her seat.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>In class, Nat dutifully gave her full attention to the lecture and was careful to not let Lottie catch her breaking focus. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When the bell rang, Natalie stayed seated until Lottie came to retrieve her. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Come.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie walked her to trig and stopped at the door. She turned and looked at Natalie directly.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m not going to see you again until lunch. I don’t want you to be late to class because you’re trying to find me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat stifled the urge to argue. “Thank you.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’ll get lunch for us and meet you at our spot. Be good.” She kissed her forehead and walked away.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat watched her go. She felt the tether extend, grow taught, and break with a painful snap that hit her in the chest. She turned, walked into the room, sat down at her desk, and pulled out her notebook. She looked at her watch and considered how much time until lunch. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Two and a half hours.</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van arrived and addressed Nat, imitating Lottie’s smooth locution. “</span>
        <em>
          <span>Good morning Natalie</span>
        </em>
        <span>.” </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie answered her, unfocused. “Good morning Van.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van sat down behind her “New watch?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes, Lottie gave it to me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Oh, did she? She’s pretty great, huh?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes.” Nat was only half engaged, reading as she answered.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“She’s such a good girlfriend.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat nodded. Van kept on baiting.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“She’s so helpful, giving you a watch so you know the time.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat turned around to look at her. She looked at Van like she was a fellow follower in the cult of Lottie. “She </span>
        <em>
          <span>is</span>
        </em>
        <span>.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van’s eyes flicked to the watch on Natalie’s wrist. “It must feel good, to be so well cared for.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat nodded, now totally engaged. “It does feel good.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van leaned in a little closer now, voice warm but with a hint of humor. “She must really love you. I mean… making sure you’re not late. Making sure you eat. Making sure you say the right thing...”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie didn’t hear the sharpness under it and smiled. “She’s so smart, Van. Like, she just knows what I’m supposed to do </span>
        <em>
          <span>all the time</span>
        </em>
        <span>.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van nodded slowly, keeping her voice level. “Right. It’s not like you were able to do that for yourself before.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie glanced down at her desk. “Yeah, well…” She considered the statement. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Before</span>
        </em>
        <span>. It felt distant. Messier, colder. “It’s hard to choose right.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van grinned tightly. “Yeah, it can be… especially if you’re dealing with y’know… bad habits.” </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat understood her implication and nodded in agreement. Van continued, “I guess that’s one way of correcting them… not thinking for yourself.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>That made Nat glance back at her. Van’s smile was patient now, waiting her out. Like she was trying to get Nat to say it herself.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie felt a warmth spread through her chest. “It does. I like it.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van gave a low whistle under her breath, sitting back again. “Damn.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie nodded once, automatic.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van tilted her head, voice still mild, but colder now under the surface. “What about when you don’t want to do what she says?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie frowned slightly, caught off balance. “What?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Just wondering.” Van’s tone was light, but it didn’t feel light.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s hand flexed where it rested on her desk, her thumb brushing automatically over the leather strap on her wrist.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van didn’t push. She just sat back like they were two people waiting for class to start. Then, after a pause, she glanced back at Nat with a flick of her eyes. “Aren’t you supposed to be looking over your notes before class?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She was still thinking on the previous question. She felt distressed, her pulse loud in her ears, a pressure mounted in her head. She turned and opened her notebook and tried to ignore it, and soon the bell rang.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>In class she was relieved the period was short and only had a lecture portion, to save her from further social engagement. The uneasiness within her had become layered. Not only did Van’s questioning lead her to a kind of conundrum, but that fact also made her feel as though she didn’t want to talk to Van, and that didn’t sit right with her either. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>
          <span>What about when you don’t want to do what she says?</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The sound of a voice beside Lottie’s in her head made it feel crowded.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When class ended, she found herself wishing she could stay in the room and sit through the next two periods of math classes until lunch. She sighed, rose, and left without saying anything further to Van. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie walked the halls feeling hollowed out. Every sound felt distant, like she was drifting. She looked at the watch. </span>
        <em>
          <span>One hour forty-five minutes.</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When she got to Spanish, she found Kev already there with his backpack in the seat next to him. “Hey Nattie.” He moved his backpack, inviting her to sit with him.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“We missed you last night. We went out and got fuckin’ blasted. I tried callin’ you up at the girl’s house but some lady said you weren’t there.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yeah.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I kinda thought you were stayin’ there now.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“We went to the movies.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Oh. Uh, ok.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat said nothing, and Kevyn restarted.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I was gonna ditch today but I was lookin’ forward to seein ya. We never hang anymore.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat sighed. “We just hung out on Saturday night.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p><span>“Yeah but… y’know. Like we just ate dinner and smoked a cig dude. That’s not really </span><em><span>hangin</span></em> <em><span>out</span></em><span>.”</span></p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Then what the fuck is it?” Her voice snapped sharper than she meant. Her face felt hot, the pressure blooming behind her face, a pulsing in her head. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Be good.</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“It’s fuckin’ weird. You just sit around talkin’ all the time? That’s boring as fuck.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Talking isn’t boring if you’re not a fuckin’ idiot.” The ache pulsed harder. Her vision fuzzed at the edges. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Be good.</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Whatever man, fuck you.” He sat back, laughing it off. He kept trying. “So uh, wanna hang out later?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She took a deep breath. Her head throbbed. “No, Kev.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Because you’re going over to that girl’s house?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Just come over later, dude. I made you a new mix.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Her mind went to the last time they listened to one of his mixes. </span>
        <em>
          <span>We’re best friends. Maybe more than friends once. </span>
        </em>
        <span>Another voice in her head.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Kev,” she said slower, steadying herself. Her fingers brushed the leather strap at her wrist like it could keep her under control. “I don’t want to hang out. I don’t want to be with you. Lottie is my </span>
        <em>
          <span>girlfriend</span>
        </em>
        <span> and I’m going back to her place after school because I’m </span>
        <em>
          <span>staying</span>
        </em>
        <span> there.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Her voice didn’t waver. She saw the blood leave his face. “Oh, uh. Ok. That’s um… that’s cool dude.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She said nothing, hoping it’d been enough to make him give up.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Well she can come too.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p><span>“Oh my fucking </span><em><span>god.</span></em><span>”</span> <span>she muttered, more to herself. Her voice lost some control again. “You just fuckin’ said hanging out with her was boring.”</span></p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She felt her anger, powerful and real, boiling below the surface. She felt her nose bleed, warm and slow.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“What?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Her head felt full. The pressure built to a point she felt it would be physically painful to speak again. She rose, wiping her nose with the back of her hand, smearing red faintly against her wrist.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She crossed the room and took a seat against the wall. She tried to compose herself. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Posture. Focus. Good.</span>
        </em>
        <span> Kevin didn’t follow her.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>By the time the bell rang, her pulse had steadied and the pain had faded. She traced her thumb along the strap of her watch.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Fourth period passed like waiting for a clock to run out. Natalie sat through it, half-engaged, clicking along with the instructions. Her mind was on the time. Fifty minutes until lunch. Thirty-seven. Twenty-one. Her pulse counted down alongside it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When the bell rang, she rose with purpose. She walked straight to their new spot in the courtyard, off to the side, semi-private. She sat down and folded her hands in her lap and waited. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She kept her mind blank on purpose, shutting out thoughts of Van, Kevyn, anything else. She focused on waiting. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Lottie’s coming</span>
        </em>
        <span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>A few minutes later, she felt her before she saw her.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Hello Natalie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie looked up, breath already easier. Lottie was there with two trays balanced in her arms. “Hi Lottie.” She sat straighter.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie placed a try in front of her and sat down next to her. “Eat.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.” Natalie picked up the sandwich and took a bite without hesitation. Already she felt the difference. The stress in her unwinded itself, her hands grew steady.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie watched her a moment, eyes soft, then started picking at her own food.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie savored the comfortable silence. She felt relaxed, grateful to be back with Lottie, happy to act according to her direction. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Thank you Lottie.</span>
        </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She turned to her, and initiated light conversation. “How was class?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie looked at her and smiled. “Thank you for asking. It was alright. Shauna aced that test. I didn’t do as well and she was kinda smug about it. Then in Anatomy we started to review for the frog dissection next class.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat looked at her and gave a small smile. “Are you looking forward to it?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie laughed at Nat’s mischievous look. “A little bit, yeah. Should be, you know, weird, but in a good way.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yeah.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie smiled at her and stroked her hair. “You seem happy.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat leaned into her touch. “Yeah, well. I’m happy I’m with you again.” She turned to look at her directly. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie let her gaze linger before she turned back to her food. “How were your classes? Did you see your friends?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Classes were good and yeah. I saw Van and Kev was in class today.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie reached over slowly and took Natalie’s wrist in her hand. Her thumb traced the edge of the watch strap gently. “Did you like wearing my watch? It looks good on you.” </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie. I love it. Thank you.” </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie noticed the blood on her hand. “Natalie, what happened to your hand?” She looked at her directly again. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie looked back at her and caught her fixed gaze. She felt its warm gravity, coaxing a response from her. “I, uh…”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Tell me what happened.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I got mad.” Natalie said finally, voice lacking intonation. “In Spanish. Kevyn was… talking too much.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“What did he say?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“He wanted to hang out. He wouldn’t drop it.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie’s thumb pressed lightly against her wrist, grounding her. Her other hand came up to touch her cheek.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“And you?” Lottie prompted gently. “What did you say?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I told him no. I told him about you.” Natalie’s voice wavered. “I tried to not be mean but he kept pushing me. I moved seats when I thought I was getting mad.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie hummed quietly. “Good girl.” She kept holding.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat felt herself melting. She recognized the pleasure of praise and pull and welcomed it. She felt tension in her muscles relax, felt her mind get softer.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“But you got upset,” Lottie said again, a little firmer now.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“And your nose bled.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I see.” She broke her gaze and looked away. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie still felt bound. She leaned her head on Lottie’s shoulder and stayed silent.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Are you feeling better?” Lottie said cooly.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good.” She turned and kissed her head “Finish your lunch so we can go smoke.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie picked her sandwich back up, calm again. Silent.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>By the time lunch ended, Natalie was fully re-centered. She followed Lottie to class, sat down beside her, and took her hand.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van and Tai arrived not long after, arriving from lunch with Shauna and MAri arguing behind them. They slid into their seats, Van dropping her bag onto the floor between her and Nat.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tai leaned forward and spoke past her “Missed you guys at lunch today.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van didn’t say anything. She just leaned back to allow Tai to talk, watching Natalie’s reaction.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie felt the attention and felt the quiet rush of needing to say the right thing. </span>
        <em>
          <span>Be good.</span>
        </em>
        <span> Lottie nudged her, prompting her, then turned to retrieve a notebook from her bag.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie kept her voice calm. Not too eager. Not too clipped. Exactly the way Lottie had trained her to speak. “After last week I kinda didn’t feel like sitting with the group.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tai frowned in contemplation and nodded. “Fair enough. Mari and Shauna’s constant bitching can be annoying.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie felt emboldened. She was doing well. “Yeah. Where we sit now… I mean, it’s just quieter.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Van’s voice cut in then, imitating her tone. “Maybe you just like the quiet now.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie didn’t look at her and didn’t go further.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The conversation broke with the bell. Natalie felt Van’s gaze linger. She stayed quiet, hands steady, eyes forward. She didn’t feel the distress she had in trig, though. She felt the effect of Lottie beside her. She felt under control.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>As Coach Scott dropped the lights and started a film, Lottie leaned toward her just slightly, voice low enough that no one else could hear.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good job, baby. You answered well.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>A pulse of warmth bloomed in Natalie’s chest. “Thank you Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The rest of the school day passed in a steady, quiet rhythm. After health, Lottie walked Natalie to Ms. Barch’s room, her hand at the small of her back, wrist brushing wrist. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>During the final classes of the day, NAt stayed focused. She didn’t count the minutes like she had before lunch. She didn’t need to. She just checked her watch every so often, letting the subtle presence of Lottie remind her that they weren’t really separated.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When the final bell rang, she found Lottie without even thinking. Her body moved on its own toward the field, slipping into step behind her.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>At practice, Natalie changed into her gear and stretched alongside the others. She stayed close to Lottie, following her lead. When they split them into drills, Natalie focused on her movements with a quiet kind of intensity. No showing off, no small talk, just steady, obedient work. Her eyes flicked to Lottie periodically, searching for a nod or glance of approval. When practice was over, she fell back into step behind her.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When they got home, the evening settled into the pattern Natalie now loved: homework, dinner, smoke. Natalie worked through two assignments quickly while Lottie made final preparations for her calc test. When Natalie finished before Lottie, she went to the bed and laid beside her. “What do you want me to make for dinner?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie hummed and stroked her hair. She answered her, calm and sure. “Pasta. There’s fresh spinach in the fridge. Garlic too. You remember how I showed you?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.” Natalie got up and started preparing it without hesitation. She worked mindlessly, systematically– wash, chop, stir, serve. She returned up to the bedroom and laid again by Lottie, waiting until she was ready to eat.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>They ate dinner, relaxed, and spoke minimally. “It’s delicious Natalie. Thank you”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“You’re welcome Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Afterward, they went outside for their smoke. Lottie lit her cigarette and passed it to Natalie, then lit her own and sat back. Lottie watched her, eyes calm and thoughtful. “How do you feel about today, Natalie?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie exhaled smoke slowly. “Good.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Is that so?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Van seemed to be in a mood. Did something happen with her in trig?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“No.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Natalie.” Lottie was looking at her now.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>She didn’t meet her gaze. “I don’t know. She was asking about you I guess.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“And what did you say?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Nat tried to choose her words wisely. Feeling the weight of the question. “I told her the same thing I tell you. I like that you help me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie reached over, took her chin in her hand and turned her head so that she met her gaze. “Do you like it?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie. It feels good.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie tilted her head, and held her gaze steady. “Did you like getting mad? With Kevyn?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“No Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie reached for her again and brushed her cheek. “Maybe it’s time for a little more training. We don’t want that to keep happening.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s heart raced. “Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good girl.” Lottie said softly. “When we finish this cigarette, we’ll go inside. I will play piano and you will wait for me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie nodded, eyes steady. When Lottie broke her gaze, she sighed at the feeling of being let go. She sat quietly, one hand in her lap, eyes forward.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie lay stretched on the divan, arms folded loosely on her torso, her head on the cool fabric. Lottie’s music filled the room. The notes comprised slow, drifting phrases that rose and fell like breath, gentle and weightless, yet threaded with something darker beneath. Each measure folded into the next, quiet and deliberate, until Natalie felt wrapped in it completely, her body heavy and her mind quiet.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Her eyes were half-lidded, focused on nothing. She didn’t think. The day slipped away as easily as breath leaving her chest.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The music made her feel pliant, like her whole body was being tuned to Lottie’s rhythm. Her pulse slowed to match the pacing of the notes. Every so often, a phrase would repeat, almost like a mantra in sound.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The music stopped mid-phrase. Natalie’s breath caught before she even realized the silence had begun. She opened her eyes fully just as Lottie’s voice, calm and cool, cut through the quiet. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Sit up, Natalie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie pushed herself upright immediately. Her limbs felt heavy and pliant from lying still so long, but she didn’t hesitate. She sat on the edge of the divan, spine straight, hands folded in her lap, eyes cast down, waiting.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie approached slowly, deliberate, her gaze steady. She stopped directly in front of Natalie, looking down at her in silence for a moment that felt stretched and deliberate.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I want to work on something with you tonight,” Lottie said finally. Her voice was low, even. “You’ve been a very good girl, but there’s more we can do. You agree, don’t you?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.” Natalie’s voice came soft, automatic.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie reached down and touched under her chin, tipping her face up. “You still get upset sometimes. With Kevyn. With Van. That can’t happen.” Her fingers traced Natalie’s jawline lightly, almost like a reward. “I don’t like it when you get upset. It isn’t good for you.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>“It isn’t good for me.”</b>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I want to show you something.” Lottie stepped back just slightly. “Stand up.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie obeyed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie circled her once, slowly, the same way she had before the punishment. Natalie felt her pulse climb at the memory of it. But instead of striking, Lottie spoke again: “Hold your hands behind your back.” She complied. “Good. Now, don’t speak. Don’t move unless I tell you to.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie nodded once. Her entire body hummed with the tension of anticipation. Her stomach fluttered. She felt how exposed she was, how controlled. She loved it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie stepped in again, standing just inches away. She leaned in, voice barely audible.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m going to tell you terrible things,” Lottie said. Her tone was matter-of-fact. “I’m going to tell you you’re useless. That you don’t know how to make decisions. That you wouldn’t survive a day on your own.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s breath hitched.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“When I say it, you’ll listen, and you’ll thank me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie closed her eyes briefly. “Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie reached out and ran her fingers along the leather strap of the watch on Natalie’s wrist. “Because it’s true, isn’t it?”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.” The words felt like they lived in her.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie let her hand trail up, resting on Natalie’s cheek, then across her throat, light as a whisper. Her thumb pressed just slightly against the hollow there—not choking, just enough to feel.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Say you’re mine.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m yours, Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“And you need me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I need you.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie’s hand closed slightly, her grip firm on her neck but not cruel. “Good girl.” Then she released her and stepped back again.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m not going to hurt you.” Lottie said calmly, voice still soft. “That’s not what this is. But you’re going to learn that when I say something, you believe it.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes, Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Good girl.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie hummed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie circled her again, deliberately slow, her steps quiet on the floor. Natalie kept her eyes forward, her hands folded tightly behind her back.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Then Lottie spoke, low and certain. “You lose control sometimes. You get angry.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s jaw tensed automatically. Her throat felt tight.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“But it’s not your fault,” Lottie went on, voice calm, measured, like she was explaining something simple and inevitable. “It’s because you didn’t have anyone to keep you steady before. You had to solve all of your problems, and all you know is violence.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s pulse slowed slightly. Her shoulders softened.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“But now…” Lottie stepped back in front of her again, touching her chin gently. “Now you have me. You will stay calm because that’s what I want you to do. You can trust me to take care of the things that upset you.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie felt the words sink in. Her eyes fluttered closed, just for a second. “Thank you Lottie”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m the reason you don’t need to hit anyone. I’m the reason you don’t talk back.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie’s hand moved to rest lightly against her neck again. Steady, present, not constricting. “You don’t need to control yourself anymore. I do that for you.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie swallowed hard. “Thank you Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“That’s right.” Lottie’s eyes held hers steady now, gaze direct and unwavering. “Because you’re mine. And I take care of what’s mine.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie’s voice wavered slightly, but she answered clearly: “I’m yours.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Say it again,” Lottie said softly, thumb brushing just beneath her jaw.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“I’m yours, Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“And I don’t get angry anymore…”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie repeated it like a prayer. “I don’t get angry anymore, because you control me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Say it again, baby.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span> “I don’t get angry anymore, because you control me.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Lottie smiled, quiet and warm. “Good girl.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>After a long pause, Lottie stepped in one last time, hand on Natalie’s neck, thumb brushing under her jaw. She leaned in to kiss her, slow and deep, with absolute control. Natalie melted into it, feeling the kiss like a seal on her obedience.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>When Lottie pulled back, she spoke one last time, quiet and final:</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Tomorrow, we’ll do more.”</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Natalie felt her pulse jump at the promise. She whispered it back without even thinking.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>“Yes, Lottie.”</span>
      </p>
