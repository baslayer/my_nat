  "Listen, if you don't straighten out soon Miss Scatorccio, I doubt you'll be walking in May."
</p>

<p>
  Mr. Colburn was doing his best to communicate the gravity of Natalie's situation to her, but the girl could not bring herself to feel the least bit concerned. Her mind was adrift as she sat, only half-listening to the advisor's warnings. She had heard these kinds of interventions what felt like a million times, always conducted by some authority figure that she knew didn't even believe their own words. They all had to hold these meetings with her- she knew. They all had to tell her there was another path for her, but she heard their true feelings between their spoken words: she was just another hopeless burn out, destined to become a future dead beat. It was just a matter of time. 
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes she believed it, too. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Who needed to be constantly living up to some set of expectations? It wasn't what
  <em>
    she
  </em>
   wanted after all. 
  <em>
    She 
  </em>
  wanted to do whatever the fuck she wanted. Fuck this guy. Alone in her head, she became resentful. 
  <em>
    Maybe I'll drop out, and you could be rid of me. You'd like that wouldn't you? You don't need me around here.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  "Miss Scatorccio? Are you listening me? For your number of unexcused absences, the teachers will have to award you an F for the semester. If you don't start going to class, this could result in expulsion."
  <em>
    This mother fucker.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  If she were honest with herself, she knew she was just letting summer vacation last a little longer. She figured she could get away with missing class until the soccer season started, then play catch up. Nat had spent the last two weeks practically in a stupor, though, and she was having trouble focusing on anything at all- including this ass face talking at her now. 
  <em>
    Fuuuck this school.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    Shit.
  </em>
   Soccer tryouts would probably start in another week, and the other varsity girls had probably started conditioning. Nat groaned. 
</p>

<p>
  "Can I go now?"" Nat asked, interrupting Mr. Colburn.
</p>

<p>
  "Miss Scatorccio. If I were you, I would be thinking about soccer, and the promising season our Yellowjackets have ahead of them. A National Title could mean a scholarship opportunity to many of these young girls, including yourself. 
</p>

<p>
  "I've had a talk with Coach Martinez, and he's just as concerned as I am. As I understand it, the team will be missing a key player this season if you don't shape up."
</p>

<p>
  "You don't give a shit." 
</p>

<p>
  "Excuse me, Miss Scatorccio, but a foul mouth will not help your case. I'll have to write you up for that and now you'll have to go to detention after school instead of practice with your teammates."
</p>

<p>
  <em>Please let this be over.</em> She could not stand to listen to this guy a second longer. She didn't know what she would end up doing after school, but <em>fuuuck that.</em> 
</p>

<p>
  Mr. Colburn waited for Natalie to respond, but she just glared at him, now sitting on the front half of her chair, acting in demonstration of how ready she was to leave. "I suppose that's everything then. Detention will be help in the library after the last bell." He dismissed her and handed her the yellow slip as she made for the door.
</p>

<p>
  Walking down the hall, slip in hand, her mind wandered again. Getting back in the field. Getting back to class. Sleeping at night. It all suddenly seemed like so much to think about after a <em>wild</em> couple of months. She smirked to herself as she replayed the summer in her head. She had spent most days with Kevyn and Ant binging and getting blasted. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    Fuck. I could use some fun. 
  </em>
  She went looking for them.
</p>

<p>
  Her smile faded as her thoughts drifted to the team, now. No soccer this year? She'd have a lot more time on her hands. Kevyn would be happy about that. He was always saying she should just quit so they could hang out more. Nat roller her eyes now, they were already best friends, how much more time did he want to spend with her? At least he always had booze and drugs. Even if he was always up her ass, he did know how to have fun. 
</p>

<p>
  Nat found him and Ant smoking behind the school. 
</p>

<p>
  "Yooo. What's up? Ant yelled out to her. "We were just talking about you. Miss too-good-for-us-torccio finally decided to grace us with her presence, huh?"
</p>

<p>
  Now she was annoyed again. Why was he such a fucking loudmouth? She waited to respond until she was close enough not to yell. "Shut up. You're lucky I don't turn around now. You guys look like shit."
</p>

<p>
  Ant laughed, but Kevyn just looked at Natalie. "You don't."
</p>

<p>
  Nat said nothing and let a couple awkward beats pass.
</p>

<p>
  He started again. "We been drinking since noon. I'm smashed. We tried to find you during lunch but didn't see you and thought you were still ditchin'... wait. What <em>are</em> you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
  "I had this stupid ass meeting with stupid ass Colburn. He gave me some shit about cutting and then threatened to kick me out of school. He's a mother fucker." She stuffed her slip into her backpack and pulled out a well-loved pack of Marlboros. She reached over and pulled the lighter hanging from Kevyn's belt loop to light it.
</p>

<p>
  "Fuckin' idiot."
</p>

<p>
  "Yep." Nat dragged on her cigarette.
</p>

<p>
  They all stood around in silence while Nat stayed in her head. She was regretting looking for them. Was she having fun? She was already bored. She wished she were smoking this cigarette alone. 
</p>

<p>
  "I was gonna ask if you wanted to come back to my place to hang out, but I guess you just want to go home and be a bitch to no one huh"
</p>

<p>
  She glared at him as she pulled on her cigarette. "What's going on at your place?"
</p>

<p>
  "My cousin s'pposed to come n' drop a bag so we were gonna keep up this buzz and party if you're down."
</p>

<p>
    <em>Yes! And we're back.</em> She could have applauded. "Yeah ok. I'll come by later."
</p>

<p>
  A full smile spread over Kevyn's face. "Cool."
</p>

<p>
  The bell rang as she stomped out the cigarette, offering her an exit as the conversation trailed off once again. She made her way back into the halls and considered whether she'd go to her last period. She couldn't remember the last time she'd gone to the last class of the day. <em>Well, as good a reason as any to not go to either.</em>
</p>

<p>
  As she turned to make her way to the side exit, she saw her teammate, Lottie Matthews, down the hall. Natalie swore under her breath. Nat's instinct was to move to avoid her but instead she found herself still, staring. 
</p>

<p>
  The contrast in their appearances was stark. Lottie was tall and neat and had good posture and fine clothes. She exuded a soft, bright confidence that made Nat suddenly hyper-self-aware of her own appearance. She saw what her friends looked like, she knew she couldn't be much better.
</p>

<p>
  No sooner did Lottie see her give a cheerful wave. "Hey, Nat!"
</p>

<p>
  Nat approached her, not getting too close, worried she might smell. 
</p>

<p>
  Lottie leaned in to try to close the gap and asked, her voice low for effect, "Come here often?"
</p>

<p>Nat leered back at her. "Are you flirting with me Matthews?"</p>

<p>
  "Oh jesus fucking christ. I'm just glad to see you finally back at school. The team and I were all getting worried. Jackie told everyone that coach told her you might not be coming to school this year at all." She looked at Nat expectantly now. Silently compelling her to refute the rumor.  
</p>

<p>
  "Oh, he's just full of shit."
</p>

<p>
  "So you're back at school now?"
</p>

<p>
  "Well," she looked away as she tried to piece together an explanation and failed. Looking back at Lottie, "I'm here because I had to meet with Colburn because I'm out of absences for the semester."
</p>

<p>
  "So you're dropping out?"
</p>

<p>
  "I don't know."
</p>

<p>
  "What the fuck, Natalie? You don't know? Shut up. Make a decision and make the right one. You get your ass to class then come to practice."
</p>

<p>
  "You make it sound so easy."
</p>

<p>
  "Because it is."
</p>

<p>
  Nat stayed silent for a moment before adding, "Colburn gave me a detention slip so if I stay here, I go to class then detention. If I leave now, I don't have to go to either one and then I never have to come back." She smirked, self-satisfied with her iron-clad logic. 
</p>

<p>
  "Nat you're so smart but that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Go to class. Go to detention. We're all going for burgers after training, and you can come with us. That way you can have something to look forward to during your 3 hours in purgatory."
</p>

<p>
  "I'll think about it." Nat needed an out. "I don't even know when detention lets out."
</p>

<p>
  Lottie glared at her. "Give me a piece of paper."
</p>

<p>
  Nat reached into her backpack and produced the yellow detention slip. Lottie took it, rolling her eyes.
</p>

<p>

  "This is my pager number. Page me when you get out. If I'm at practice, I'll leave early and if I'm at the diner, I'll come back and get you."

</p>



<p>

  Nat took the slip back from her, confused. "Why?"

</p>



<p>

  "Because we miss you and we need you, Natalie. Are you paying attention, at all? Everyone will be so happy if you show."

</p>



<p>

  Nat stood silent, unsure of what to say. She had already made up her mind that she was leaving for the day. Lottie wasn't going to change her mind.

</p>



<p>

  "Ok." Nat was trying to escape now.

</p>



<p>

  "Ok? Ok. Good. I'll see you later."

</p>



<p>

  "Yeah, sure." 

</p>



<p>

  Lottie watched as Nat continued in the same direction anyway, still headed for the side exit. 

</p>



<p> </p>



<p>

  Nat went straight to Kevyn's without stopping at home. She wanted to celebrate.

</p>



<p>

  As she walked up, Kev swung out himself with the front door as he opened it to let her inside. "Welcome my queen!"

</p>



<p>

  Nat laughed at his enthusiasm. She liked this Kevyn so much more than the moping guy she was with an hour ago. She got excited. She was ready to join the party.

</p>



<p>

  The stale, pungent air assaulted her senses as she walked in, a heady mix of teenage boy funk, beer, weed, and the chemical odor of freshly broken cocaine. 

</p>



<p>

  "Holy shit!" Nat's jaw dropped when she saw the lines Kevyn had set up and the formidable amount still left uncut. "I thought you said you were getting a bag" there"s a least two balls there."

</p>



<p>

  "Yeah well, my cousin stopped by and he was bein" all high and generous. I guess he got it super cheap and he wanted to bless. We don't have to do it all tonight." He answered in a rush.

</p>



<p>

  "Well, you put it all out." Nat still stood agape.

</p>



<p>

  A wide grin stretched across his face at the observation. "Yes I did."

</p>



<p>

  Nat laughed and gave him a high five. Kev handed off the straw and Nat 4 took full lines in rapid succession, two to each nosrtil.

</p>



<p>

  "Woah dude!"

</p>



<p>

  "I gotta catch up." Nat joked and punched at Kevyn's stomach. She felt the drug hit her skull almost instantly. Seeping into her system through her sinuses, it burned like a chemical fire and made her nose run and eyes fill with tears. Wiping her face then triumphantly throwing her fists in the air, she proclaimed, "I'm dropping out!" 

</p>



<p>

  "Oh shit dude!!" Ant was the first to react. He gave her a big hug, instinctively building on the tone that Nat had taken with them. Kevyn's enthusiasm seemed to wane though. "Oh, yeah dude? That"s cool."

</p>



<p>

  Nat's skin was buzzing, she already wanted to do more. She registered Kevyn's reaction but it fell so low on her priorities in that moment. The high felt too good. She watched as Kev and Ant queued then took their turns, silently waiting for the rotation to get back to her. 

</p>



<p>

  When it did, she took the straw and ripped two more as Kevyn started pouring a round of shots. She thought about following up to Kevyn's reaction but the party mood was back. 

  <em>

    Why bother with the problems of ten seconds ago? 

  </em>

  She burst out laughing at the joke she was making to herself in her head. 

  <em>

    This is now!

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  The afternoon roared on in a similar fashion. Rounds of the blow punctuated by liquor and cheap beer. Nat was euphoric. She felt like she could explode with the amount of love she felt for her best friends. She felt profoundly that these were the nights she lived for. Not a single thought outside of their raucous penetrated her mind. She finally felt happy. She finally felt everything good. Her very existence felt like it was a firework exploding over a grand celebration.

</p>



<p> </p>



<p>

  The hours wore on and the alcohol ran dry. As the night started to slip into morning Nat started to feel uneasy. Without the booze to take the edge off, the anxiety from the drugs was mounting in her as everything started to come rushing back. The meeting with Colburn, the confrontation with Lottie. No school. No soccer. 

  <em>

    Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  The realization hit her hard. She was fucking stupid. School wasn't hard. She wanted to play soccer. She didn't want to feel like 

  <em>

    this

  </em>

   anymore.

</p>



<p>

  <em>

    What were you fucking thinking?

  </em>

   She was panicked now. She had to get off this train. She suddenly felt like she could die at any moment. This was life or death. Her mind was racing.

</p>



<p>

  She couldn"t just leave. Geeked out and walking in the street at 3 a.m.? No way she was risking a night in jail. Kevyn? No way she was getting in a car with him right now. 

</p>



<p>

  In a moment she was asking urgently, "where's my backpack". 

</p>



<p>

  "I think It's still by the door, dude." Kevyn and Ant were a few notches below her at that moment, having not had kept pace with her. 

</p>



<p>

  She rifled through the bag of loose papers and found her yellow detention slip. "where's your phone?"

</p>



<p>

  "What the fuck, dude? My phone? Do you know what time it is?"

</p>



<p>

  "I gotta leave." 

</p>



<p>

  "You don't gotta do shit Nat, come over here and try to come down a bit."

</p>



<p>

  "No. I can't. I have to leave." She found the phone in the kitchen. 

</p>



<p>

  Practically ripping it off the wall, she punched the number with frantic fingers. She put the receiver to her ear, took a deep breath, and waited for a moment that seemed to stretch impossibly long. Then the beep.

</p>



<p>

  She punched the number to Kevyn's house like it was an SOS and hung up with finality. Still breathing too heavy, she tried to calm herself down. 

  <em>

    Deep breath

  </em>

  . She didn't know if Lottie would even be up to hear the beeper, to return her call, but she did feel the title wave of anxiety recede ever so slightly for having made the call to page her. 

  <em>

    Deep breath.

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  Kevyn's phone started ringing. She picked it up immediately and tried to offer the calmest "hello" she could muster.

</p>



<p>

  "Hello? Who is this?" The voice across the line hit her ears like a salve. 

</p>



<p>

  "Lottie, It's Nat. I need your help."

</p>



<p>

  "Nat? What"s wrong? You sound weird."

</p>



<p>

  "I'm at Kevyn's and I need a ride home. Can you come pick me up?"

</p>



<p>

  Lottie heard a weird edge in Nat's words. Like she was forcing them out somehow. Like she was short of breath but she was maybe trying to hide it? Lottie wasn't sure but she knew it sounded like Nat might need a lot more than a ride home.

</p>



<p>

  "I'm coming."

</p>



<p>

  "Great, Lot. I owe you one."

</p>



<p> </p>



<p>

  Lottie rolled up to the house not 15 minutes later and immediately Nat emerged to meet her. Lottie watched her, half running, carrying her backpack over her shoulder, wearing the same clothes she had seen her in the afternoon before. Lottie could see Nat looked like hell.

</p>



<p>

  Nat blew into the car like a gust of wind and melted into the seat as she breathed heavily.

</p>



<p>

  "Wow Lot way to come through in the clutch. I really needed to get the fuck out of there and get home."

</p>



<p>

  Lottie glared at her. "What the fuck is going on Nat? You ditched school, ditched the team, and now you've asked for a ride in the middle of the fucking night? you look like you just ran a marathon."

</p>



<p>

  Nat looked over at her and tried to slow her panting. Lottie's face was the picture of concern looking back at her. 

  <em>

    I must look like fucking hell.

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  The drugs still coursing through her compelled her to brutal honesty and she blurted out "I dropped out then did a ton of blow to celebrate and now I think maybe it was cut with something else and maybe I did too much and I just started to feel like, like, crazy, and I didn't want to die in that room so I paged you because I still had your number written on the slip in my backpack because I didn't go to detention because I dropped out."

</p>



<p>

  Lottie looked at her, her expression softening. "Oh, Natalie." She handed her a bottle of water that she had brought for her and sighed. "I'm not taking you home."

</p>



<p> </p>



<p>

  By time they pulled up to the Matthews estate, Nat was nursing a nose bleed and a splitting headache. She felt her face throbbing from the pressure of her inflamed sinuses. She tried to remain calm and not give away how much pain she was in, but Lottie could see the tears running clearly down her bright red cheeks. She finally huffed and cried through dripping blood and boogers, "it hurts so bad". 

</p>



<p>

  "Come on Natalie. Let's go inside and get you cleaned up."

</p>



<p>

  Inside Lottie sat Nat down on a divan in the middle of a large, dimly lit living room. "Stay here." 

</p>



<p>

  Lottie retreated and as Nat sat and waited for her, she felt a cool draft of air conditioned air pass over her burning hot skin. She smiled to herself at the sensation. She felt like she had just been plucked from hell and led into salvation. 

</p>



<p>

  Lottie returned with a box of tissues, a trash bin, two pills, and a glass of water. 

</p>



<p>

  "If you get blood on any of this furniture. I'm never inviting you back." Lottie told her, smirking.

</p>



<p>

  Nat was relieved Lottie was making jokes. It had been a crazy hour for her, and she was taking it all in with such grace. 

</p>



<p>

  "Now, these are two of my mom's Xanax. they'll help with coming down from the high, but I'm not sure you should try to go to sleep immediately. I think your heart could stop or something."

</p>



<p>

  Nat nodded and took the pills and the glass of water from her. She placed them in her mouth and swallowed with a loud gulp, followed by a deep breath.

</p>



<p>

  "I'm going to play the piano for a little bit. Please try to relax and stay awake. don't go to sleep without telling me first, ok?"

</p>



<p>

  "Yeah Lot. I feel better already." She blew her nose a few times, relieving more pressure.

</p>



<p>

  Lottie crossed the room and sat down on the bench. She lined herself up and started playing the dreamiest song Nat had ever heard. The notes reached her ears and soothed every tensed muscle in her body, one by one. She felt serene only moments in. 

  <em>

    Does she listen to this stuff all the time? Woah.

  </em>

   "I didn't know you played piano"

</p>



<p>

  Lottie kept her eyes on the sheet music as she answered. "My dad has had me in lessons since I was a little girl. He says playing music is good exercise for the brain. I didn't like it when I was younger but now I'm glad I can play. It feels good."

</p>



<p>

  Natalie nodded in understanding.

</p>



<p>

  They sat like that together in the spacious room for a long time, Lottie playing for Nat to lull her into full relaxation. 

</p>



<p>

  Natalie realized she had been playing the same song over and over. "Do you play this song all the time? It's amazing."

</p>



<p>

  "Right now, yes. It's a piece I've just learned so I've been playing it a lot."

</p>



<p>

  "Mmmm." Nat felt like she was melting. She breathed deeply.

</p>



<p>

  She felt like time was stretching around her. How long had she been in this room, listening to Lottie play? It didn't matter. The music washed over her, like audible silk. She felt like she was being cleansed. 

</p>



<p>

  <em>

    Where am I?

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  "Lottie?"

</p>



<p>

  "Yes Natalie?"

</p>



<p>

  "Where am I?"

</p>



<p>

  "You're with me." 

</p>



<p>

  <em>

    Oh.

  </em>

</p>



<p>

  "Lottie?"

</p>



<p>

  "Yes Natalie?"

</p>



<p>

  "I'm sleepy."

</p>



<p>

  "Ok." And the music stopped.

</p>



<p>

  Natalie's eyes drifted closed as her body felt suspended in air, still adrift in a harmonic sea. Somewhere far away she could hear the pads of feet moving across a room. She then felt the presence of a body before her, and a hand stroke across her face.

</p>



<p>

  "Open your eyes, Natalie"

</p>



<p>

  Her lids lifted slowly. Eyes open and on Lottie, but still not seeing anything. Her mind soft and somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. 

</p>



<p>

  Lottie bade Nat look her well in the darkness of her eyes. "Regardez-moi pien dans le noir des mes yeux."

</p>



<p>

  Then she made little passes and counterpasses on Nat's forehead and temples and down her cheek and neck. Soon her eyes closed and drifted open again and her face grew placid.

</p>



<p>

  Lotties asked if her head still ached.

</p>



<p>

  "Not at all-" Nat took a deep breath, her pinholed pupils focused on Lottie. "it feels like heaven."

</p>



<p>

  "That's wonderful, sweetheart. My eyes can bring you here always. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" 

</p>



<p>

  "So much." 

</p>



<p>

  "Very good. That makes me very happy" 

</p>



<p>

  Nat was awash in pleasure. 

</p>



<p>

  "And in this heavenly place, there is only us. Only my words and your submission to them. Do you understand?" 

</p>



<p>

  Nat hummed. 

</p>



<p>

  "Tell me you love to be here with me" 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"I love to be here with you." </b>

</p>



<p>

  "In our heaven, my words are the only thing in your mind. There is nothing else." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Nothing else." </b>

</p>



<p>

  "My words will sink deep into you; they will guide you even after you ascend back to consciousness."

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Guide me" </b>

</p>



<p>

  "And now listen to me carefully, Natalie." Lottie continued, stroking Nat's hair. "If you let go of any of my words, you will lose this heavenly feeling." 

</p>



<p>

  Natalie's face contorted and she crushed her eyes closed.

</p>



<p>

  "Natalie. Open your eyes."

</p>



<p>

  Nat reopened them, and they refocused on Lottie's intense gaze.

</p>



<p>

  "The pain you were feeling will return to you, same as it was before" Lottie persisted.

</p>



<p>

  "No." She choked.

</p>



<p>

  Lottie sighed and repeated with more force, "Natalie, you must listen to me." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"I must listen." </b>

  Her face relaxed again.

</p>



<p>

  "Do not disobey my words." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Do not disobey." </b>

</p>



<p>

  "Or the pain will return." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Or the pain will return."</b>

   

</p>



<p>

  "Very good, Natalie. You're a good girl. I love being here with you." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"I love being here with you." </b>

</p>



<p>

  "You want to be here with me, under control." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"I want to be here."</b>

   

</p>



<p>

  "You need to be under my control." 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"I need to be under your control."</b>

   

</p>



<p>

  "Good girl, Natalie. You're doing so well. Now, thank me" 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Thank you."</b>

</p>



<p>

  "Now go to sleep" 

</p>



<p>

  <b>"Sleep."</b>

</p>



<p>

  Natalie eyes closed languidly, and she drifted into a peaceful, heavy sleep.
