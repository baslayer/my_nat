<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Listen, if you don’t straighten out soon Miss Scatorccio, I doubt you’ll be walking in May.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Mr. Colburn was doing his best to communicate the gravity of Natalie’s situation to her, but the girl could not bring herself to feel the least bit concerned. Her mind was adrift as she sat, only half-listening to the advisor’s warnings. She had heard these kinds of interventions what felt like a million times, always conducted by some authority figure that she knew didn’t even believe their own words. They all had to hold these meetings with her- she knew. They all had to tell her there was another path for her, but she heard their true feelings between their spoken words: she was just another hopeless burn out, destined to become a future dead beat. It was just a matter of time. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Sometimes she believed it, too. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. Who needed to be constantly living up to some set of expectations? It wasn’t what &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; wanted after all. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;She &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;wanted to do whatever the fuck she wanted. Fuck this guy. Alone in her head, she became resentful. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Maybe I’ll drop out, and you could be rid of me. You’d like that wouldn’t you? You don’t need me around here.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;⎯ “Miss Scatorccio? Are you listening me? For your number of unexcused absences, the teachers will have to award you an F for the semester. If you don’t start going to class, this could result in expulsion.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;This mother fucker.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;If she were honest with herself, she knew she was just letting summer vacation last a little longer. She figured she could get away with missing class until the soccer season started, then play catch up. Nat had spent the last two weeks practically in a stupor, though, and she was having trouble focusing on anything at all- including this ass face talking at her now. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Fuuuck this school.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Shit.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; Soccer tryouts would probably start in another week, and the other varsity girls had probably started conditioning. Nat groaned. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Can I go now?” Nat asked, interrupting Mr. Colburn.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Miss Scatorccio. If I were you, I would be thinking about soccer, and the promising season our Yellowjackets have ahead of them. A National Title could mean a scholarship opportunity to many of these young girls, including yourself. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’ve had a talk with Coach Maritnez, and he’s just as concerned as I am. As I understand it, the team will be missing a key player this season if you don’t shape up.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“You don’t give a shit.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Excuse me, Miss Scatorccio, but a foul mouth will not help your case. I’ll have to write you up for that and now you’ll have to go to detention after school instead of practice with your teammates.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Please let this be over. She could not stand to listen to this guy a second longer. She didn’t know what she would end up doing after school, but &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;fuuuck that.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Mr. Colburn waited for Natalie to respond, but she just glared at him, now sitting on the front half of her chair, acting in demonstration of how ready she was to leave. “I suppose that’s everything then. Detention will be help in the library after the last bell,” he dismissed her and handed her the yellow slip as she made for the door.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Walking down the hall, slip in hand, her mind wandered again. Getting back in the field. Getting back to class. Sleeping at night. It all suddenly seemed like so much to think about after &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;a wild couple of months&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;. She smirked to herself as she replayed the summer in her head. She had spent most days with Kevyn and Ant binging and getting blasted. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Fuck. I could use some fun. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She went looking for them.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Her smile faded as her thoughts drifted to the team, now. No soccer this year? She’d have a lot more time on her hands. Kevyn would be happy about that. He was always saying she should just quit so they could hang out more. Nat roller her eyes now, they were already best friends, how much more time did he want to spend with her? At least he always had booze and drugs. Even if he was always up her ass, he did know how to have fun. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat found him and Ant smoking behind the school. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yooo. What’s up?” Ant yelled out to her. “We were just talking about you. Miss too-good-for-us-torccio finally decided to grace us with her presence, huh?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Now she was annoyed again. Why was he such a fucking loudmouth? She waited to respond until she was close enough not to yell. “Shut up. You’re lucky I don’t turn around now. You guys look like shit.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Ant laughed, but Kevyn just looked at Natalie. “You don’t.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat said nothing and let a couple awkward beats pass.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;He started again. “We been drinking since noon. I’m smashed. We tried to find you during lunch but didn’t see you and thought you were still ditching… wait. What &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;are &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;you doing here?” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I had this stupid ass meeting with stupid ass Colburn. He gave me some shit about cutting and then threatened to kick me out of school. He’s a mother fucker.” She stuffed her slip into her backpack and pulled out a well-loved pack of Marlboros. She reached over and pulled the lighter hanging from Kevyn’s belt loop to light it.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Fuckin’ idiot.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yep.” Nat dragged on her cigarette.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They all stood around in silence while Nat stayed in her head. She was regretting looking for them. Was she having fun? She was already bored. She wished she were smoking this cigarette alone. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I was gonna ask if you wanted to come back to my place to hang out, but I guess you just want to go home and be a bitch to no one huh”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She glared at him as she pulled on her cigarette. “What’s going on at your place?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“My cousin s’pposed to come n’ drop a bag so we were gonna keep up this buzz and party if you’re down.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Yes&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;! &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;And we’re back. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She could have applauded. “Yeah ok. I’ll come by later.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;A full smile spread over Kevyn’s face. “Cool”.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The bell rang as she stomped out the cigarette, offering her an exit as the conversation trailed off once again. She made her way back into the halls and considered whether she’d go to her last period. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d gone to the last class of the day. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Well, as good a reason as any to not go to either&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;As she turned to make her way to the side exit, she saw her teammate, Lottie Matthews, down the hall. Natalie swore under her breath. Nat’s instinct was to move to avoid her but instead she found herself still, staring. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The contrast in their appearances was stark. Lottie was tall and neat and had good posture and fine clothes. She exuded a soft, bright confidence that made Nat suddenly hyper-self-aware of her own appearance. She saw what her friends looked like, she knew she couldn’t be much better.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;No sooner did Lottie see her give a cheerful wave. “Hey, Nat!” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat approached her, not getting too close, worried she might smell. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie leaned in to try to close the gap and asked, her voice low for effect, “Come here often?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nat leered back at her.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Are you flirting with me Matthews?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Oh jesus fucking christ. I’m just glad to see you finally back at school. The team and I were all getting worried. Jackie told everyone that coach told her you might not be coming to school this year at all.” She looked at Nat expectantly now. Silently compelling her to refute the rumor.  &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Oh, he’s just full of shit.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“So you’re back at school now?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Well…” she looked away as she tried to piece together an explanation and failed. Looking back at Lottie, “I’m here because I had to meet with Colburn because I’m out of absences for the semester.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“So you’re dropping out?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I don’t know.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“What the fuck, Natalie? You don’t know? Shut up. Make a decision and make the right one. You get your ass to class then come to practice.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“You make it sound so easy.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Because it is.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat stayed silent for a moment before adding, “Colburn gave me a detention slip so if I stay here, I go to class then detention. If I leave now, I don’t have to go to either one and then I never have to come back.” She smirked, self-satisfied with her iron-clad logic. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Nat you’re so smart but that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Go to class. Go to detention. We’re all going for burgers after training, and you can come with us. That way you can have something to look forward to during your 3 hours in purgatory.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’ll think about it.” Nat needed an out. “I don’t even know when detention lets out.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie glared at her. “Give me a piece of paper.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat reached into her backpack and produced the yellow detention slip. Lottie took it, rolling her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Because we miss you and we need you, Natalie. Are you paying attention, at all? Everyone will be so happy if you show.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat stood silent, unsure of what to say. She had already made up her mind that she was leaving for the day. Lottie wasn’t going to change her mind.&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat went straight to Kevyn’s without stopping at home. She wanted to celebrate.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;As she walked up, Kev swung out himself with the front door as he opened it to let her inside. “Welcome my queen!”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat laughed at his enthusiasm. She liked this Kevyn so much more than the moping guy she was with an hour ago. She got excited. She was ready to join the party.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The stale, pungent air assaulted her senses as she walked in, a heady mix of teenage boy funk, beer, weed, and the chemical odor of freshly broken cocaine. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Holy shit!” Nat’s jaw dropped when she saw the lines Kevyn had set up and the formidable amount still left uncut. “I thought you said you were getting a bag… there’s a least two balls there.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yeah well, my cousin stopped by and he was bein’ all high and generous. I guess he got it super cheap and he wanted to bless. We don’t have to do it all tonight.” He answered in a rush.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Well, you put it all out.” Nat still stood agape.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;A wide grin stretched across his face at the observation. “Yes I did.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat laughed and gave him a high five. Kev handed off the straw and Nat 4 took full lines in rapid succession, two to each nosrtil.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I gotta catch up.” Nat joked and punched at Kevyn’s stomach. She felt the drug hit her skull almost instantly. Seeping into her system through her sinuses, it burned like a chemical fire and made her nose run and eyes fill with tears. Wiping her face then triumphantly throwing her fists in the air, she proclaimed, “I’m dropping out!” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Oh shit dude!!” Ant was the first to react. He gave her a big hug, instinctively building on the tone that Nat had taken with them. Kevyn’s enthusiasm seemed to wane though. “Oh, yeah dude? That’s cool.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat’s skin was buzzing, she already wanted to do more. She registered Kevyn’s reaction but it fell so low on her priorities in that moment. The high felt too good. She watched as Kev and Ant queued then took their turns, silently waiting for the rotation to get back to her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When it did, she took the straw and ripped two more as Kevyn started pouring a round of shots. She thought about following up to Kevyn’s reaction but the party mood was back. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Why bother with the problems of ten seconds ago? &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She burst out laughing at the joke she was making to herself in her head. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;This is now!&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The afternoon roared on in a similar fashion. Rounds of the blow punctuated by liquor and cheap beer. Nat was euphoric. She felt like she could explode with the amount of love she felt for her best friends. She felt profoundly that these were the nights she lived for. Not a single thought outside of their raucous penetrated her mind. She finally felt happy. She finally felt everything good. Her very existence felt like it was a firework exploding over a grand celebration.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The hours wore on and the alcohol ran dry. As the night started to slip into morning Nat started to feel uneasy. Without the booze to take the edge off, the anxiety from the drugs was mounting in her as everything started to come rushing back. The meeting with Colburn, the confrontation with Lottie. No school. No soccer. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The realization hit her hard. She was fucking stupid. School wasn’t hard. She wanted to play soccer. She didn’t want to feel like &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; anymore.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;What were you fucking thinking?&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; She was panicked now. She had to get off this train. She suddenly felt like she could die at any moment. This was life or death. Her mind was racing.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She couldn’t just leave. Geeked out and walking in the street at 3 a.m.? No way she was risking a night in jail. Kevyn? No way she was getting in a car with him right now. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;In a moment she was asking urgently, “where’s my backpack”. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s still by the door, dude.” Kevyn and Ant were a few notches below her at that moment, having not had kept pace with her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She rifled through the bag of loose papers and found her yellow detention slip. “Where’s your phone?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“What the fuck, dude? My phone? Do you know what time it is?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I gotta leave.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“You don’t gotta do shit Nat, come over here and try to come down a bit.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“No. I can’t. I have to leave.” She found the phone in the kitchen. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Practically ripping it off the wall, she punched the number with frantic fingers. She put the receiver to her ear, took a deep breath, and waited for a moment that seemed to stretch impossibly long. Then the beep.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She punched the number to Kevyn’s house like it was an SOS and hung up with finality. Still breathing too heavy, she tried to calm herself down. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Deep breath&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;. She didn’t know if Lottie would even be up to hear the beeper, to return her call, but she did feel the title wave of anxiety recede ever so slightly for having made the call to page her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Kevin’s phone started ringing. She picked it up immediately and tried to offer the calmest “hello” she could muster.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Hello? Who is this?” The voice across the line hit her ears like a salve. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Lottie, it’s Nat. I need your help.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Nat? What’s wrong? You sound weird.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’m at Kevyn’s and I need a ride home. Can you come pick me up?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie heard a weird edge in Nat’s words. Like she was forcing them out somehow. Like she was short of breath but she was maybe trying to hide it? Lottie wasn’t sure but she knew it sounded like Nat might need a lot more than a ride home.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’m coming.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Great, Lot. I owe you one.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie rolled up to the house not 15 minutes later and immediately Nat emerged to meet her. Lottie watched her, half running, carrying her backpack over her shoulder, wearing the same clothes she had seen her in the afternoon before. Lottie could see Nat looked like hell.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat blew into the car like a gust of wind and melted into the seat as she breathed heavily.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Wow Lot way to come through in the clutch. I really needed to get the fuck out of there and get home.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie glared at her. “What the fuck is going on Nat? You ditched school, ditched the team, and now you’ve asked for a ride in the middle of the fucking night? you look like you just ran a marathon.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat looked over at her and tried to slow her panting. Lottie’s face was the picture of concern looking back at her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;I must look like fucking hell.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The drugs still coursing through her compelled her to brutal honesty and she blurted out “I dropped out then did a ton of blow to celebrate and now I think maybe it was cut with something else and maybe I did too much and I just started to feel like, like, crazy, and I didn’t want to die in that room so I paged you because I still had your number written on the slip in my backpack because I didn’t go to detention because I dropped out.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie looked at her, her expression softening. “Oh, Natalie.” She handed her a bottle of water that she had brought for her and sighed. “I’m not taking you home.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;By time they pulled up to the Matthews estate, Nat was nursing a nose bleed and a splitting headache. She felt her face throbbing from the pressure of her inflamed sinuses. She tried to remain calm and not give away how much pain she was in, but Lottie could see the tears running clearly down her bright red cheeks. She finally huffed and cried through dripping blood and boogers, “it hurts so bad”. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Come on Natalie. Let’s go inside and get you cleaned up.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Inside Lottie sat Nat down on a divan in the middle of a large, dimly lit living room. “Stay here.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie retreated and as Nat sat and waited for her, she felt a cool draft of air conditioned air pass over her burning hot skin. She smiled to herself at the sensation. She felt like she had just been plucked from hell and led into salvation. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie returned with a box of tissues, a trash bin, two pills, and a glass of water. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“If you get blood on any of this furniture. I’m never inviting you back.” Lottie told her, smirking.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat was relieved Lottie was making jokes. It had been a crazy hour for her, and she was taking it all in with such grace. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Now, these are two of my mom’s Xanax. They’ll help with coming down from the high, but I’m not sure you should try to go to sleep immediately. I think your heart could stop or something.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat nodded and took the pills and the glass of water from her. She placed them in her mouth and swallowed with a loud gulp, followed by a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’m going to play the piano for a little bit. Please try to relax and stay awake. Don’t go to sleep without telling me first, ok?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yeah Lot. I feel better already.” She blew her nose a few times, relieving more pressure.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie crossed the room and sat down on the bench. She lined herself up and started playing the dreamiest song Nat had ever heard. The notes reached her ears and soothed every tensed muscle in her body, one by one. She felt serene only moments in. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Does she listen to this stuff all the time? Woah.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; “I didn’t know you played piano”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie kept her eyes on the sheet music as she answered. “My dad has had me in lessons since I was a little girl. He says playing music is good exercise for the brain. I didn’t like it when I was younger but now I’m glad I can play. It feels good.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie nodded in understanding.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They sat like that together in the spacious room for a long time, Lottie playing for Nat to lull her into full relaxation. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie realized she had been playing the same song over and over. “Do you play this song all the time? It’s amazing.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Right now, yes. It’s a piece I’ve just learned so I’ve been playing it a lot.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Mmmm.” Nat felt like she was melting. She breathed deeply.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt like time was stretching around her. How long had she been in this room, listening to Lottie play? It didn’t matter. The music washed over her, like audible silk. She felt like she was being cleansed. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Where am I?&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Lottie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yes Natalie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Where am I?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“You’re with me.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Oh.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Lottie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yes Natalie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I’m sleepy.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Ok.” And the music stopped.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie’s eyes drifted closed as her body felt suspended in air, still adrift in a harmonic sea. Somewhere far away she could hear the pads of feet moving across a room. She then felt the presence of a body before her, and a hand stroke across her face.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Open your eyes, Natalie”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Her lids lifted slowly. Eyes open and on Lottie, but still not seeing anything. Her mind soft and somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie bade Nat look her well in the darkness of her eyes. “Regardez-moi pien dans le noir des mes yeux.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Then she made little passes and counterpasses on Nat's forehead and temples and down her cheek and neck. Soon her eyes closed and drifted open again and her face grew placid.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lotties asked if her head still ached.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Not at all-" Nat took a deep breath, her pinholed pupils focused on Lottie. "it feels like heaven."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"That's wonderful, sweetheart. My eyes can bring you here always. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"So much." &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Very good. That makes me very happy" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat was awash in pleasure. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"And in this heavenly place, there is only us. Only my words and your submission to them. Do you understand?" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat hummed. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Tell me you love to be here with me" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;"I love to be here with you." &lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"In our heaven, my words are the only thing in your mind. There is nothing else." &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;"Nothing else." &lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"My words will sink deep into you; they will guide you even after you ascend back to consciousness.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;"Guide me" &lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"And now listen to me carefully, Natalie.” Lottie continued, stroking Nat’s hair. “If you let go of any of my words, you will lose this heavenly feeling." &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie's face contorted and she crushed her eyes closed.&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Natalie. Open your eyes.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat reopened them, and they refocused on Lottie’s intense gaze.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"The pain you were feeling will return to you, same as it was before" Lottie persisted.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"No." She choked.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie sighed and repeated with more force, "Natalie, you must listen to me." &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Her face relaxed again.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
