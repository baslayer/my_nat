  <p>
    <span>Natalie woke up to the ringing alarm. </span>
    <em>
      <span>5:30.</span>
    </em>
    <span> “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie! </span>
    </em>
    <span>Turn it </span>
    <em>
      <span>off!” </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie groaned and didn’t move. The ringing continued for a moment until Natalie got out of the bed and took the alarm from the nightstand. She investigated the alarm and found the switch on the back </span>
    <em>
      <span>Alarm On-Off. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She slid the switch and sighed with relief when the ringing ceased. Nat returned to her place and went back to sleep.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The next time she woke it was to Lottie shaking her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Shit </span>
    </em>
    <span>Natalie! Get </span>
    <em>
      <span>up</span>
    </em>
    <span>!” Nat rolled over and saw Lottie getting out of bed in a rush. She watched her go into the bathroom and heard the sounds of hurried morning preparations behind the door. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was slow to move again. She looked over at the clock- </span>
    <em>
      <span>7:30</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Natalie groaned at Lottie’s panic. </span>
    <em>
      <span>We have plenty of time</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Natalie got out of bed and changed into her school clothes. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She waited for Lottie to finish in the bathroom and went in as Lottie rushed past her without a word. Nat splashed her face with cold water, brushed her teeth and ran her fingers through her hair. It crossed her mind that she’d miss her run but she was more or less unperturbed. </span>
    <em>
      <span>We’re pretty early.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She nodded to herself.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she came back into the bedroom she found Lottie with her hair in a tight bun, bangs pinned to her skull, sitting at her vanity doing her makeup. Nat went back into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Damn it.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She took more cool water to her eyes when she noticed their puffiness, and she looked for a hairbrush and hair tie to manage her mane, which now struck her as wild and unkempt. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She emerged again to find Lottie dressed and packing a duffel bag with their soccer clothes. She looked at the clock and saw the time again- </span>
    <em>
      <span>7:45.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Nat nodded calmly. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Still 30 minutes to the late bell</span>
    </em>
    <span>. She stood around dumbly watching Lottie move hurriedly around the room. Nat watched her from the desk chair finish with the duffel bag and continue to her backpack. She looked from the desk to her backpack and found Lottie had already packed her folders and notebook for her. “Uh Lottie, can I do something?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie didn’t look at her. “No. Let’s go.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They parked and heard the first bell ring from the parking lot. Nat heard Lottie exclaim under her breath, “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Fuck.</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat followed her as she walked at a brisk clip. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie!</span>
    </em>
    <span> it’s fine we’re not late! Slow down.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They arrived at homeroom seconds before the bell. Lottie turned to Nat, “sit down” and continued to put her things on her desk at the front of the class. Nat watched as she went to Mr. O’Neill.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Mr. O’Neill, good morning! Sorry I’m late I just-”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Don’t worry Lottie! Things happen, I’m just glad you’ve made it. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you!” He smiled warmly at her. “And I see you found our friend Natalie on the way in. Very good!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you Mr. O’Neill. What did I miss?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat stopped listening. She felt a pang of guilt for derailing their morning, but internally fought it stubbornly. </span>
    <em>
      <span>It’s not like we actually were late, anyway</span>
    </em>
    <span>. She went into her bag and retrieved her personal statement. She deposited it into the bin and returned to her seat, crossed her arms, and waited for class to begin.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After class she stood and waited for Lottie by the door. “Hey Lot-” Nat tried to talk to her as she walked by. Lottie cut her off. “What is it Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I just, I…” She almost apologized but she stopped herself. She thought Lottie was being dramatic about her near-tardiness and firmly felt she had nothing to apologize for. “Are you ok?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her like she was an idiot. “No, Nat, not really.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt herself absorbing the stress radiating from her. “Well, uh, can I help?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie turned to her directly and glared at her. “Just go to class Natalie. I’ll see you at practice.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Just go to class.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she went to trig she took a seat in the front row and retrieved her Unit circle and exercises from her backpack. She approached Mrs. Fuller at her desk, assignments in hand. “Good morning, Mrs. Fuller. I have these done for you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Mrs. Fuller looked at her skeptically. “Is that right, Miss Scatorccio?” She took her papers from her and investigated. “You did these?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uh, yeah?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I want you to be honest with me, Natalie. Did you copy these from someone else?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What? No. I did them.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Mrs. Fuller eyed the mismatched handwriting of Nat's name and the work and sighed. “Unfortunately Miss Scatorccio, I’m not sure I believe you. I’ll give you two options: either you can take these back from me and do them yourself for a penalty, or you can hand them in with no penalty and take your make-up quiz today.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie answered without hesitation. “I’ll take the quiz.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok. You can take it in the second half of class after the lecture. Would you like your unit circle back to review?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was angry at her accusations. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She doesn’ think I can do it. Bitch.</span>
    </em>
    <span> “No.” She wanted to spit at her feet.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Mrs. Fuller nodded. “Ok Miss Scatorccio, please take your seat.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat returned to her seat, seething. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I’m gonna make that bitch eat her words.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She shook her head to herself. The morning had shortened her fuse and she felt ready to blow at the teacher’s provocation. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Fucking. Bitch!</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van entered the room and found Nat sitting at the front, arms crossed. “Well good morning, sunshine! Trouble in paradise?” She took the seat behind her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, nothing. Just the last time I saw you, you looked like someone had just dropped a brick on your head and now you look like you’re ready to throw that brick through a window.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“This fucking cunt thinks I copied my work. Fucking calling me a liar and shit.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Woah! Take it easy. Did you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>No</span>
    </em>
    <span>. I did the work. It wasn’t even hard. She just thinks I’m fucking dumb.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“To be fair, you </span>
    <em>
      <span>did</span>
    </em>
    <span> just come back to school after basically dropping out. You’re like, pulling an academic resurrection. Forgive the non-believers.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Whatever.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you sure it’s nothing to do with Lottie, loverboy?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat turned to look at her “</span>
    <em>
      <span>No.</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Very convincing.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sighed. “I turned the alarm off this morning and we were almost late to school and I think she’s mad at me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sleeping in the same bed, are we?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat rolled her eyes. “No. I mean, yeah, for the past couple of nights, but it’s not like we're </span>
    <em>
      <span>sleeping together</span>
    </em>
    <span>.” Her mind went to the night before and she felt like she’d just told a half-lie. The guilt built up inside her. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Last night. This morning. Now, lying</span>
    </em>
    <span>. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s still, like, super quick dude. How long have you guys been hanging out?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat thought back to Friday night. The memory now felt distant, painful but dulled in her mind. “Since this weekend, I guess.” She realized the absurdity as she heard herself say it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s… uh, quick.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know. I just like her.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, you said that. It’s just when people like each other usually they pass notes or talk on the phone or something before they start spending nights together.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat thought about it. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She has a point</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Last school year, she had barely said more than ten words to Lottie off the soccer field. She always thought her pretty, but their social lives and cliques were distinctly separate. She thought of Kevyn and his confusion at her behavior, how he and Ant probably talked about her missing from the trio. She thought of how Lottie’s house was always so empty with no one hanging around. No parents, no friends. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Is it weird?</span>
    </em>
    <span> She pushed the thought away. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She helped you when you called her. It’s normal to be grateful. Don’t be stupid.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van was watching her and could see her wheels were turning. “As long as you’re happy.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah… she’s just, like, mad at me right now and it kinda sucks.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You can always talk to me dude.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thanks Van.” And she turned around.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sat through class and tried to focus on taking notes on the lecture. Her rancor faded as the logic of math soothed her, and when it was time for her quiz she was calm. Mrs. Fuller looked at her with surprise when she approached, ruler and protractor in hand, apparently prepared. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok Natalie, you have 15 minutes.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat executed her process confidently, having done it a hundred times over in her head. She handed the sheet back to Mrs. Fuller in less than 5 minutes with smug satisfaction. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Done already? Well mark me impressed.” She ran her eyes over the flawless submission. “I guess I owe you an apology. Very good job.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat returned to her desk and reviewed her notes as she waited for the bell.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When class let out, she went to lunch detention and took her seat at the top of the bleachers, leaning back against the wall. She let her mind wander back to Van’s questioning and tried to think critically about her weekend. She posed questions to herself in an attempt to converge on satisfactory explanations.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><em><span>Why did I call her?</span></em> <em><span>You panicked. You had her number.</span></em></p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Why did you have her number? She gave it to me, so I could go with the team to the diner.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She nodded to herself. So far, so good.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Why didn’t she take me home?</span>
    </em>
    <span> She paused. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She was worried about me.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Fair enough. Even Kevyn had said she had been acting erratically.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>When I got to her house, I went to bed. I left in the evening when I woke up.</span>
    </em>
    <span> That progression was clear and obvious. She moved on.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Why did I go back? </span>
    </em>
    <span>In hindsight it struck her as odd. She thought of Kevyn and how he’d told her he had been expecting her. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Why </span>
    </em>
    <span>didn’t </span>
    <em>
      <span>I go to Kevyn’s? </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She sat with the question for a long time. She couldn’t put herself back into the place where she had decided to go to Lottie’s house and not Kevyn’s. When she looked back, she only remembered a sort of… pull. A pull to go running, a pull to go to Lottie’s house.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She shivered at the memory of the sensation. She thought of the previous day after being with Lottie at her house, the feeling of being connected to her by tether until they had made it to practice. </span>
    <em>
      <span>We’re going to practice now. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She thought of the voice echoing in her head, crowding out any thought that formed in her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>For the first time, Natalie found herself thinking Lottie was </span>
    <em>
      <span>strange.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She pictured her and saw her visage focused on her in her mind’s eye. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Natalie, listen to me.</span>
    </em>
    <span> The sound came from the space around her- she heard it as if Lottie were in front of her, speaking. The hallucination diverted her train of thought from the critical track it had been on. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>She’s so beautiful. So perfect.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She thought of the previous night and her heart rate raced at the memory of how she’d worked herself up next to a sleeping Lottie. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I’m a good girl and I want to come.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She felt herself react again and cleared her throat as she tried to compose herself.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Good girl.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Never in her life had she considered herself a rule-follower, let alone </span>
    <em>
      <span>good. </span>
    </em>
    <span>And her warm reaction to it now felt… unfamiliar. She tried to self-analyze, to build an explanation and trace roots in her head. She hated her dad, she hated his beatings, but never once had she bent to him. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>He’d called her names, threatened her when she’d had boys over, but he hadn’t stopped her from doing anything. She thought of the boys she’d been with, how she’d only half liked them, liking more the feeling of besting her dad by getting away with hooking up with them. </span>
    <em>
      <span>He could never stop me from doing </span>
    </em>
    <span>shit</span>
    <em>
      <span>.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She smiled to herself as she thought fondly of her young, rebellious self. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then, she thought of the day he died, her horror when she’d pulled the trigger, the fear she felt when he’d rushed toward her, and finally the emptiness after he’d tripped. Her smile fell and she felt herself suddenly fighting back tears. </span>
    <em>
      <span>It’s ok, it’s over. It was a long time ago. It’s done.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She stopped her line of internal questioning. She decided she needed to give herself a break from the self-inquisition. She looked at the clock. </span>
    <em>
      <span>15 more minutes</span>
    </em>
    <span>. She realized that she wouldn’t be seeing Lottie in fifth hour today and she groaned to herself. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I hope she’s not still mad.</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She sat watching the clock for the remainder of detention. When it let out she made her way to the computer lab. She found the class soothing. She followed directions and clicked where she was told, and before she knew it the bell was ringing for the final period of the day.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she got to class she found Mr. O’Neill there, listening patiently to Ms. Barch. “Did you </span>
    <em>
      <span>hear me? </span>
    </em>
    <span>Fine Timothy, ignore me, just like </span>
    <em>
      <span>he </span>
    </em>
    <span>did!” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Of course I’m listening, Janet.” He saw Nat enter the room and sit herself at a lab table. “Oh hi Natalie! How is your day going?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Fine”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well that’s very good! I’ll see you tomorrow.” He stood and gave Ms. Barch a quick kiss before leaving the room. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie rolled her eyes at them. “You keep your eyes to yourself young lady.” Ms. Barch reprimanded. “Do you have your lab contract? We have a lot planned for today.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, Here you go” She produced the contract and handed it to the teacher. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok. Looks good.” You’ll be partnering with Misty Quigley.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat groaned and stood and made her way to the empty stool next to the bubbly blonde girl. “Hi Natalie! Isn’t this great? We get to be partners, again!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Misty had been Nat’s lab partner in the previous school year in their biology class. Nat was the only person that had enough patience to partner with Misty. Partially because Misty was so happy to cover for Nat when she was absent and do all the work, but also because she felt for her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Misty, she knew, was more or less an outcast in the school. She was the team “manager” for the Yellowjackets, but no one ever included her in team social events. Nat didn’t particularly like any of the girls on the team anyway, except for Van, so she didn’t hold it against Misty for not being liked by them. </span>
    <em>
      <span>No surprise when a bunch of haters do some hating.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Still, her bubbly attitude grated on her nerves, especially after the day she’d had. “I was partners with Mari, but she asked to switch to be Danny’s partner and Ms. Barch was all ‘Fine, enjoy supporting a man!’ It was really funny. You would’ve laughed.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When the bell rang, Ms. Barch called the class to attention and Nat pulled out her notebook to follow along. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh wow Nat! I didn’t know you took notes! Do you want to see my notebook? You can copy what I have from the classes you missed.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure Misty, thanks.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat spent the class transcribing notes and letting Misty handle the assignment. Again she felt soothed by the rote task. Before long the bell rang and she gathered her things. “See you at practice!” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“See ya, Mist.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Nat got to the locker room she found Lottie already changed and talking with Laura Lee. She saw she had the duffel bag. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Lot, can I get my stuff out of your bag?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I already took your stuff out.” She pointed to a neat pile on the bench by the lockers.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, ok. Uh, thanks.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Nat made her way onto the field, she felt the absence of Lottie’s form in front of her. She walked as though she were drifting without purpose, like something was missing from her. Her eyes drifted to Lottie and she put a word to the feeling- </span>
    <em>
      <span>untethered</span>
    </em>
    <span>.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she arrived at the group they were busy stretching and talking amongst themselves. “Hey Lot”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her, and for a moment her eyes held Nat, she felt a calm relief as the feeling of a connection reformed in her. “Hi Natalie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt the coldness of her words like a punishment. She looked away from her like she’d been reprimanded. She started stretching in silence as the rest of the girls continued their conversations.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Tryouts went off without event. Natalie was back on her game after a weak showing the day before, and coach offered her much encouragement. “Keep it up Scatorccio!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was ambivalent to the praise. She felt adrift and bored, and when tryouts were over she didn’t wait around. She took her things and decided to go to Kevyn’s house.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She let herself in without knocking. Kevyn and Ant were there on the couch, smoking and nursing beers. “Hey losers”. She sat between them and leaned back.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well look who it is… I thought we’d lost ya to the dark side Nattie.” Ant hadn’t seen her since the previous Friday.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What the fuck are you talking about?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know, what are you talking about? Last time I saw ya you were riding the rails talkin about droppin out and now Kev says you’re at school all the time, hangin around some preppy freak.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“The fuck, Kev?” She punched him.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know dude. He was asking where you were at.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well you don’t gotta tell him shit.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sorry Nat. But, like, what’s the big deal? You were at school and you were hanging out with that chick.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Whatever. Can I hit that?” She took the blunt from Kev and sat on it for a few hits. “You got any more beer?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The afternoon went on without event and Nat hung around watching TV until it got dark. “I gotta get home, I’ll see you guys later.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Bye Nattie” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Nat got home she went straight to her room and sat on the bed. She looked to her mirror, where she had written Lottie’s pager number, and found a second number written below it, with the word </span>
    <em>
      <span>home </span>
    </em>
    <span>in rounded, feminine print.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat repeated it to herself and went to the kitchen phone to dial the number. It rang twice before someone answered. “Um, is Lottie there?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“One moment please. May I ask who’s calling?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok Natalie, one minute.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat waited in silence.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hello?” </span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Lot.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hi Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So, uh… what’s up?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nothing. I’m studying. What’re you doing?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, I… uh… just got home. I was at Kev’s”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah… so... uh… are we good?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Why didn’t you wait for me after practice?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know. I felt, like, off. I didn’t know if you wanted me to wait for you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thanks for leaving me your number.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat held, trying to think of a way to prolong the conversation.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Is there anything else, Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, um… this morning. I’m, uh… sorry. I didn’t mean to, like, stress you out.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She heard Lottie sigh on the other end of the line. “Thank you, for apologizing, Natalie. I appreciate it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you mad at me?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, I’m just… it’s hard for me when I break routine.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well geeze, Lot, we weren’t even late to class.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>You</span>
    </em>
    <span> weren’t late, but I was. I’m supposed to be there 15 minutes before the first bell.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt guilty for not figuring it out before. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Of course, she’s the student aide. </span>
    </em>
    <span>“I didn’t know.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I know. It still doesn’t change that you turned the alarm off and didn’t wake me. You still were the one that made us late.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I know.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s important to wake up at the same time every day. It’s important to stay on schedule. I can’t just… I can’t </span>
    <em>
      <span>not</span>
    </em>
    <span> do that.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you ok, Lottie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I think so.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Can I come over?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Did you do any of your homework when you were at Kevyn’s house?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat laughed at the notion. “Nope.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well I think maybe you should stay home and try to do at least one assignment. Ok?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok. Thanks Lot.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome Nat. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, bye.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Bye.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat returned to her room, partially satisfied with the conversation. She felt relieved that she’d apologized but she also had new questions. She thought about the idea of schedules and routines, and how the past two days had gone so smoothly for her. She thought of the Unit Circle and how soothing it was to execute the process. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then today had begun abnormally. She’d slept late, she hadn’t gotten to run in the morning, no shower, no process. Just acting in a state of hurried reaction. She reflected on how it had affected her the rest of the day, how she had felt inconsolable at turn, every no matter the situation she was in. She had thought about her dad, which she very rarely did. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>It had only been two days.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She put herself in Lottie’s shoes. Lottie, who always looks so put together. Lottie, so on top of every task and responsibility. It must’ve been even worse for her to break a routine she’d held continuously for who knows how long. She thought of the Unit Circle again, how easy it was to do when you followed the same steps each time. She envisioned trying to do it without the process and her face contorted with the realization. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Oh.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sighed and decided to do as Lottie had suggested and do some homework before bed. It was easy and the feeling of completion emboldened her. She went to her dresser and searched through the drawers until she found an old digital clock. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She plugged it in, set the time, and then the alarm. </span>
    <em>
      <span>5:30.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat woke up to the sound of disc jockeys over the morning radio. She rose without hesitation, turned off the alarm and changed for a run. After her run, she took her shower, got dressed, made her toast, and made sure she had her soccer clothes and schoolwork in her backpack for leaving for school. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she got there, she saw she was early again and didn’t see Lottie’s car in the parking lot. Instead of going inside the school or to the back, she sat on a bench in front of the entrance and waited for Lottie to arrive.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she saw her pull in, she stood and watched as Lottie walked towards the school entrance. Lottie’s wavy hair was down and bounced around her shoulders as she strode confidently, eyes forward. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She’s so perfect</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Nat felt relief upon seeing her back to her calm, controlled self. When Lottie looked at her she swore she could feel </span>
    <em>
      <span>it</span>
    </em>
    <span> again. The connection, the pull. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Good morning Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>.” It came out of her like a song.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning Natalie. Were you waiting for me?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes. Can we walk in together?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok.” Lottie held her hand out for Nat to take it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They walked together through the school entrance, past Mr. Colburn. “I see you have a new friend Miss Scatorccio.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled at him. “Good morning, Mr. Colburn.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They went straight to homeroom and found Mr. O’Neill and Ms. Barch having a heated discussion over coffee. “See, the problem with you </span>
    <em>
      <span>men</span>
    </em>
    <span>, is that you’re never listening!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, but Janet, of course I was listening, it’s just… I mean…” He saw Lottie and Natalie and looked relieved to have an out.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning Lottie! And Natalie! So good to see you!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning Mr. O’Neill.” Lottie answered and then looked at Natalie, encouraging her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, uh, good morning Mr. O’Neill”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’ll see you later Janet, thank you for stopping by.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Goodbye Timothy. See you tomorrow, girls.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well Natalie, do you have something to work on while I speak with Lottie? We have 20 minutes until class starts.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie has plenty of homework still to catch up on, isn’t that right, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes. I have plenty to catch up on.” Natalie took her seat at her desk and pulled out an assignment.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The day went by easily. Kevyn was in Spanish, but he seemed at ease after having hung out the day before. Lunch detention came and Nat watched the clock and counted down the minutes until health class. In health class she sat with Lottie, hand in hand while coach Scott showed another video. In history class, Nat took a seat near the middle to avoid Mr. DeMartino’s ire. She got to practice in a good mood and socialized over stretches, staying next to Lottie. Over tryouts she was tough but mentored the younger players, and offered advice on how to improve.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt purposeful, happy. As she waited for the varsity practice to let out, she thought about her new routine and how satisfying it was. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Wake up. Go Running. Go to school. Go to practice. Go to Lottie’s.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She tried to think back to the last time life had come so easily to her and she couldn’t. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Such consistency stood in dramatic contrast to what she had just last week thought she wanted. Thinking of the rollercoaster that was getting high and coming down over and over made her feel nauseous. She thought of the uncertainty of waiting to score, and the excitement when she did. She thought of Kev and Ant and how she didn’t really like them, but really loved them when they were high. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>None of it held any level of consistency. None of it was comforting. It amounted to a constant push-pull, back-and-forth, that left her reactive and impulsive, out of control. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she saw Lottie running towards her she felt a swell of gratitude. “Hey Lot”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hi Natalie, are you ready to go?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes.” She grabbed her bag and walked with Lottie back to her car.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Back at Lottie’s she took her place at the desk and took out her </span>
    <em>
      <span>To Dos. </span>
    </em>
    <span>Lottie took her place on her bed and got to work, too. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After Natalie completed three assignments, she checked the clock and saw about two and a half hours had passed. “Hey Lot, are you at a stopping point? I think I’m done.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m kind of in the middle of something right now. Do you think you could try to make dinner while I finish up?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes.” Nat felt excited to have the opportunity to finally do something </span>
    <em>
      <span>for Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>. The notion that Lottie did so much for her while she had only made Lottie’s life more complicated weighed on her. “What do you want me to make?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Whatever you want. There’s a lot of food in the refrigerator. You should be able to make something out of it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded and went down to the kitchen. It was massive, of course, with stylish cabinetry and new-looking appliances. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Oh god.</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was overwhelmed. She hadn’t really done much </span>
    <em>
      <span>cooking</span>
    </em>
    <span> in her life and she wanted so bad to do something special for Lottie. She looked around, opened and closed the fridge, checked the pantry. Paced. </span>
    <em>
      <span>What the fuck am I going to do?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Lottie came down to the kitchen she found Natalie sitting at the table, waiting for her, with two plates of grilled cheese in front of her. She laughed at the sight. “All this and you wanted grilled cheese, huh?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I got nervous.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nervous? About cooking in my kitchen?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nervous about making something for you. I don’t know I didn’t want to fuck it up so I just made something I’m really good at.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, Natalie.” Lottie approached her and gave her a kiss on the forehead. “It looks delicious.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie sat down at the table and looked at Natalie. “Bon Appetit”.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>As they ate Natalie asked Lottie about her day. “Was it better than yesterday?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, thank you. It was. How was your day?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Mine was better, too.” Natalie chewed and then kept going. “I like odd days more.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh really? Why is that?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Because I get to have health class with you. It makes detention go by faster when I count down the minutes.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her and smiled “That’s sweet of you to say Natalie. I like sitting in health class with you too.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When they finished Lottie wiped her mouth and said, “thank you for dinner. You made a delicious sandwich”.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat beamed. “You’re welcome.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Smoke?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, please.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat pulled on her cigarette. “Hey Lot, do you think I could sleep here again tonight?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure, Nat. We can go to your place and get your things after this.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They went and came, and upon returning took their places in the living room. Nat laid on the divan as Lottie played and let herself melt into the notes. She found herself humming along to a song she knew and it made her feel warm. “Do you like this song Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes. It’s beautiful.” The song was sweet and dreamy and delicate, like a confession being whispered into night. It wasn’t rushed, and it breathed, like it itself was remembering something beautiful that made it sigh. “It reminds me of you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Lottie finished the song, she got up and joined Nat where she laid. “I think you’re beautiful, too, Nat.” The room was quiet but the final notes still hung in the air, echoing in Nat’s mind. She turned to look at Lottie and found her gaze was set upon her. She felt the slow pull of her and hummed at the feeling. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie.</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat tried to savor the sensation, like being pulled out to sea by a gentle current. She felt as though gentle tendrils were creeping up her brainstem and weaving their way around her lobes. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She leaned in with the feeling of inevitability, and kissed Lottie deeply. Lottie kept still at first, then matched Natalie’s intensity, languid and sure. She slipped her tongue between the blond’s lips and met no resistance. Nat’s tongue grazed hers, tentative at first, then bolder. Lottie gave out a soft sigh, and put her hands around Nat’s neck to pull her even closer. Nat felt on fire again. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat broke the kiss first “Lottie.” She tried to compose herself as Lottie began down her neck in the way Nat loved “um… do you think… we could um… go upstairs?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie paused and she looked up at Nat. “Ok”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They went up to Lottie’s room and took turns showering and changing into their sleeping clothes in the bathroom. Nat went first, and when it was Lottie’s turn she sat on the bed, and waited. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Lottie came out and laid her eyes on her, Nat almost lost her breath. </span>
    <em>
      <span>So beautiful</span>
    </em>
    <span>. </span>
    <em>
      <span>So perfect</span>
    </em>
    <span>. “Hi Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hi” Lottie approached her slowly, keeping her eyes fixed on Nat’s. Nat felt herself slipping and felt her own arousal growing low in her stomach. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lottie… I… uh…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What is it baby?” She was standing over her now at the edge of the bed. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sat agape, staring up at her. She went to raise her hands to hold Lottie but part way up they went limp and fell back to her sides. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie.”</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Natalie. I’m here with you”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt the statement land heavily in her empty head.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“I’m here with you.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“How do you feel?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Amazing.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s wonderful honey. Tell me what you want.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She tried to lift her arms again but she found they had been replaced with lead. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie.”</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie leaned down and kissed Nat again with the same intensity as before. Nat kissed her like it was the only thing she knew. Nothing had come before, and nothing would come after. It was only them, mouths against eachother’s, tongues dancing to silent music that played in their heads.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie moaned into the kiss. “Do you like that baby, you like it when I kiss you like that?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>“Yes Lottie. Thank you”</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie pulled away. “Such good manners Natalie, such a good girl. Do you want more?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Please Lottie”</span>
    </em>
    <span> Her arms were at her sides but her fists clutched the comforter next to her, her knuckles impossibly white against her alabaster complexion. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You were so good today, but yesterday… I don’t know if you’ve earned </span>
    <em>
      <span>more</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat whined. </span>
    <b>“I was so good.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You want to please me, don’t you Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“I want to please you”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Very good. You’re such a good girl for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Thank you Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Now, my sweet baby, get on your knees.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie heard and the direction enter her empty head and command her to motion. She found herself on her knees, facing the tall girl.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good girl” Natalie hummed. The praise washed over her with an impossible sweetness that made her crave more.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Have you ever gone down on another girl, Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat shook her head.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re going to do it now.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Her mind processed what Lottie was saying, but all she could do was nod. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok, go ahead baby.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat reached up and hooked her fingers into Lottie’s waistband and slid her underwear down her long legs. A complete feeling of obedience coursed through her and overwhelmed her senses. A mix of exhilaration and vulnerability that left her feeling completely powerless.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Just as Natalie felt as though she were nowhere, Lottie felt as though Nat’s tongue was everywhere. Lottie gasped audibly as it stroked along her entrance, the warmth and wetness igniting a fire deep within her. It felt as if Nat were tasting every part of her, savoring her, as if she needed to have all of Lottie against her mouth. She needed to hold onto Nat’s head, pulling her even closer, driven by an insatiable desire to keep Nat in her control.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat relished the feeling of Lottie’s hand on her head, pressing her into the place where she needed her most. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I’m yours Lottie, use me, please.</span>
    </em>
    <span> She felt completely under her control, completely at her mercy. The way her servitude pleased Lottie made her feel so perfect, so special. She could feel her own climax building with each act of control, with each word of praise.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie had never experienced anything like this, nothing compared to the overwhelming sensation of power and bliss. The way Nat’s tongue teased her entrance was so incredibly perfect, and then she pressed her tongue inside her, sending waves of pleasure rippling through her body.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s right baby, so good for me. So obedient, making me feel so good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat hummed at the praise, sending pleasurable vibrations directly into Lottie, forcing a moan to erupt from deep in her chest. Lottie moved one leg to rest on Nat’s back, trying to give her a better angle. Nat’s tongue was long, and deep inside her as it twisted and coaxed more and more pleasure from her. She felt the hungry way Nat ate against her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Were you hungry baby? Are you happy to be fed, my sweet pet?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt herself come at the term. The sensation of Lottie was everywhere, inside and out. The orgasm rippled through her and sent her further, deeper into the empty bliss. Natalie couldn’t think or feel anything beyond Lottie, beyond Lottie’s control over her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie pressed her heel into Nats back, pressing her impossibly closer. Lottie felt completely adored, like a goddess, and Natalie, her worshipper. “You’re so good Nat. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Oh my god.</span>
    </em>
    <span>” She felt her own mind sputtering out into delirium. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat went to her clit and took it into her mouth, sucking deliberately, powerfully. Lottie choked, “Oh fuck, Nat, yes- right there” Nat sucked harder. “I’m gonna come Nat, fuck, please!” Lottie moaned loudly as she broke and came with delicious intensity, shooting waves of pleasure from her core to her body. Nat drank in as her wet filled her mouth, Licking and lapping at her as Lottie rode out the aftershocks.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>As Lottie came to, she moved her leg from Nat’s shoulder and looked down at the blonde. She was struck by how beautiful she looked down on her knees, mouth wet with her cum.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie stared back at her, “Thank you, Lottie”.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie felt herself throb at the words. “You’re welcome Natalie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie padded to the bathroom and returned with a washcloth. “Come back up here.” She guided Nat back onto the bed and took her chin in her hand as she wiped her face clean. “There you go.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat smiled at her and leaned forward for a quick kiss. “Thank you”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you ready for bed?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded. </span>
