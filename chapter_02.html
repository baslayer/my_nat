<title>The First Sunday of September</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>
    <span>Nat woke up disoriented. She rose rapidly and immediately started to check herself. Her nostrils were stiff with a coating of dried blood, her clothes were damp, and strands of hair were stuck to her forehead. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then she looked around the elegant living room, and saw large windows with long shafts of light falling over tastefully ornate furniture. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Where am I?</span>
    </em>
    <span> She made for the door.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning, Natalie.” </span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie. Fuck.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Did you ask if you may leave?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>There was something in Lottie’s voice that Nat didn’t recognize. It felts like her words were probing at the base of her skull.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I didn’t say you could go.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>What the fuck? </span>
    </em>
    <span>She snorted and continued for the door.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, so now you’re all better you’re going to leave, then? And do what? Go back to Kevyn’s?” Nat stopped in her tracks. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Do I have to remind you what you put me through last night, Nat? I practically brought you back from the dead.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She didn’t remember what happened last night. She didn’t know how she got there. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Do I need her to remind me?</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No… I, uh…” Nat answered, fighting her confusion. She tried to think back to the night before but it was too opaque. “I just need to go home now”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nat! Wait.” Lottie put herself between Nat and the door. Grabbing Nat by her shoulders, Lottie bore her dark saucers into Natalie’s narrow pupils, and Natalie felt her mind go soft.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie. I need you to stay safe for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Stay safe.” </b>
    <span>Nat repeats, voice void of intonation.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You will go straight home and immediately go back to sleep.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Go straight home. Go back to sleep.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You will sleep through the night, and you won’t wake up again until morning.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Won’t wake up until morning.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“When you do wake up, you will run back here.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Run back here.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I can’t leave you alone right now Nat. You scared me. You need supervision.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“I need supervision”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s right, baby. Now go home and let me know when you make it back.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie moved from her place between Nat and the door, and upon release from Lottie, Nat felt a sudden calm clarity. She wasn’t sure what had just happened. Wasn’t she mad… or confused… </span>
    <em>
      <span>what the fuck is going on?</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“See ya later, Lot,” she said, as she let herself out the door.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Nat got home she found her mom in her place on the couch, watching TV too loud. She tried to slip past her and go to her room.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Welcome home, Nattie.” Her mom half spat. Clearly she wasn’t getting by that easily”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey mom” she tried to keep walking.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Your little boyfriend Kevyn came here looking for you not too long ago. Did you kids get in a fight?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat rolled her eyes. “He’s not my boyfriend.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“He sure thinks he is. The way he came in here asking a bunch of damn questions. When did you come home, when did you leave, where did you go… I told him, the only person that knows where you are is the lord almighty.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Whatever mom.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>At that, Nat’s mother grunted and left her alone.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat went to her room and dropped her bag on the floor. She opened the front pocket, pulled out her detention slip, and went into the kitchen. She paged Lottie her home number, hung up, and waited.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She felt confusion brewing in her mind again. What was she doing? Didn’t she just come from Lottie’s? Why would she need to page her now? She couldn’t even recall an impulse to do so when she got home. She just… did it. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Whatever.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She started to feel anxious waiting by the phone. She stared at it, willing it to ring. She felt her cheeks flush with the embarrassment of being ignored. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Wow fucking pathetic. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She had just left her house and now she’s calling again? She would hate it if someone did that to her. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Obsessed, much?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The phone rang, interrupting her inner dialogue of self abasement. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hello? Lottie?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hi, Nat.” Nat felt the knots in her stomach untangle.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I just got home. What took you so long?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What took </span>
    <em>
      <span>me</span>
    </em>
    <span> so long? You left here over an hour ago.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat didn’t want to divulge that she lived in the trailer park on the edge of town after having just seen the palatial estate Lottie called home. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh I, uh, had to make a couple of stops on the way back. But I’m here now.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well… ok. Sorry I didn’t call you back right away. I wanted to write your number down in my book.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie smiled and laughed inside at the idea of keeping a phone book. </span>
    <em>
      <span>She’s so cute.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh miss perfect has her own perfect little address book, huh?” She was trying to flirt now.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Natalie. Most people keep their contacts in an address book.” Lottie deadpanned.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was silent, stuck with the feeling she’d been reprimanded.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Anyway… thank you for calling. I’m happy to know you made it home safe.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt better. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I’m happy you’re happy.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure Lot. I’ll talk to you later” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Bye.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat hung up the phone and went back to her room. She picked up a marker and wrote Lottie’s pager number on her mirror before tossing the detention slip into the trash can. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She looked at the number for a moment and tried to think more about her night. She </span>
    <em>
      <span>had </span>
    </em>
    <span>dialed the number before. The memory was browned out in her mind’s eye, but she could see it now. She could see herself calling her from Kevyn’s house. </span>
    <em>
      <span>That’s how I got there.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie suddenly felt incredibly tired. She capped the marker and collapsed onto her mattress. In less than a minute, she was sleeping again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie woke up the next morning to the soft light of dawn filling her room. She couldn’t remember the last time she woke up feeling so calm and rested, let alone so early. She laid for a moment and considered how she’d spend her day. She thought of going over to Kev’s to see what happened with the rest of the coke from Friday night. Maybe he’d still have some and she didn’t have to worry about class on Monday. She resolved to stop by his place later in the afternoon. No way he was getting up any time soon.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The air coming from her window felt fresh and cool compared to her stuffy bedroom. She envisioned herself running in the morning air and it felt good. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Maybe I’ll go for a run. </span>
    </em>
    <span>No more soccer meant it’d be up to her to stay in shape and a run would help her take her mind off the fog of Friday night. She got out of bed and got dressed eagerly. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She stepped out the doorway and stood on the steps, bringing each of her feet up behind her to stretch out her quads. With a hop she started down the steps and ran towards her favorite route through Wiskayok. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The cool morning air on her face was refreshing, exactly how she’d imagined. It’d been a long time since she’d gone for a run like this, and she’d typically run to the park, run the loop, and go back home. Instead Nat found herself running along the route she had walked the evening before, towards Lottie’s house. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The run filled her with veins with endorphins and cleared her mind. The acute mental clarity from the physical activity was a welcome change from the fog she’d been in the past weeks and the endorphin release tempered the dopamine deficit she was feeling after her binge two nights before. </span>
    <em>
      <span>This was a good decision. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She decided as she smiled and ran.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>It wasn’t long before she was running up the long drive to Lottie’s front door. Her mood lifted and bright, she was excited to see Lottie again. Without thinking about whether Lottie would be up yet or even want to see her, Nat rang the doorbell.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie answered the door, looking completely put together, like she had been up for hours. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat grinned wide at her. “Hey Lot.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smirked at her and leaned against the door frame. She lifted her wrist and tapped the face of her watch with her index finger, looking at Nat pointedly.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re late.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat laughed and lifted an eyebrow. “So you’re not happy to see me?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stood up straight and crossed her arms, making a point of assessing Natalie’s appearance.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, I’m happy to see you. You look good. Come on in.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat stepped through the threshold and walked through the foyer to the living room she had found herself in yesterday. She looked around at the interior adorned tastefully with ornate furniture and a grand piano in the far corner. She fixated on it. </span>
    <em>
      <span>That’s right, we listened to someone playing the piano.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie went ahead of her, deeper into the house towards a table set with the trappings of a fresh continental breakfast. “Come have breakfast, Natalie. When was the last time you ate?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie looked away from the piano and over to Lottie, who was now taking a seat at the table. She looked like royalty, sitting straight with her ankles crossed under har chair, spreading her only half unfolded napkin onto her lap. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Jesus Fucking Christ.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat walked up to the second place at the table and stood behind the chair. “Lottie, what the fuck is all this? Is the queen coming, too?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie sat looking up at Nat with her hands resting in front of her, fingers interlaced against her chest. “No Natalie, I asked the staff to set this up for you. So we could have an early Sunday brunch.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Brunch, with me? Was this planned? </span>
    </em>
    <span>Her confusion made her come up blank. She was out of smart remarks. “I, uh, …”. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie tried to give her time to gather her thoughts and say something, but Nat just stood there, mouth agape. “Nat, please just sit down and eat something.” She turned away and started to grab food for her own plate.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat did as she was asked and sat down uneasily in the dining chair. Her eyes ran over the spread, which still to her was excessive. Laid in front of her were fresh fruits and breads, cheeses and yogurts, all plated with porcelain, crystal, and sterling. Her place had a glass of juice, a glass of milk, and a mug. Nat had never seen anything like it before. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>All of a sudden, she started to feel like this was all a little too much. She sat, looking over the table, and at Lottie, trying to piece together what was happening. </span>
    <em>
      <span>What am I doing here?</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat seriously tried to answer the question for herself. </span>
    <em>
      <span>I went for a run and I came here.</span>
    </em>
    <span> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She shook her head. It didn’t explain Lottie’s comment about being late, and it definitely didn’t explain why she was sitting at this ridiculous table. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie was expecting me. She asked her staff to set the table. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She nodded to herself, that explains that. The only problem is she couldn’t piece the two explanations together. She hadn’t known Lottie was expecting her until she arrived. She tried to recall a conversation with Lottie the day before, planning this very moment, but she just couldn’t see the memory. Not like when she remembered dialing her number at Kevyn’s. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Fuck. I must have been gone.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie, please eat.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, sure.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Don’t you have something else to say?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uhhhh…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you.” Natalie couldn’t help but smile as she repeated Lottie’s words.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>There were a few moments of silence as they both ate. Natalie after a few bites realized she was famished, and now worked to fill her plate with as many different fixings as she could reach. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was nibbling at the food on her plate, watching Natalie, amused.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So Nat, what did you do after you left yesterday?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nothing really. I walked home, it took forever, and when I got home I crashed again.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I thought you said you made a few stops?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Fuck. </span>
    </em>
    <span>Nat paused, trying to flesh out some details for the lie. “I stopped by Kevyn’s place. I left some stuff there.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her seriously. “Do you think that was a very good idea Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“A good idea? What fuck are you talking about?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You were freaking the fuck out when I picked you up from his house early in the morning. And now you’re telling me you went right back there?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What do you care if I go to Kev’s house? He’s my best fucking friend.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was silent. She looked straight ahead, away from Nat, her face blank as she tried to understand what could possibly through the other girl’s head.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat’s mind was reeling, at the same time trying to figure out how to backtrack the lie that had so clearly upset Lottie, but also make it clear to her she could go to Kevyn’s house any time she wanted to. “Look, I didn’t really go to Kevyn’s last night, but I was gonna go there after I left here today anyway. What’s the big deal?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was now the one that needed a moment to organize her thoughts. She sat paused before she responded.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“The big deal is that you’re going to put yourself in a place that literally just yesterday you were running out of. Why would you do that, Nat? It’s like you escaped a fire and you’re going back into the burning building because you </span>
    <em>
      <span>left some stuff there</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat was calming down, relieved to no longer have to work on the lie. “He’s my friend. Yeah we had a crazy night but that happens all the time. It’s not a burning building, it’s my best friend’s house.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nat, have you ever thought that if you didn’t spend so many nights at Kevyn’s then not as many of them would end up </span>
    <em>
      <span>crazy</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat thought about it. Her mind went back to Friday, when she went looking for Kev and found him and Ant behind the school. Looking at it from Lottie’s perspective, it was grossly obvious to Nat that she wouldn’t hang out with Kevyn or ant if it weren’t for the perks. </span>
    <em>
      <span>God damn it.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat shrugged, unwilling to cede further ground to Lottie, even if she was half-right. She started eating again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie continued the conversation. “So, why did you tell me you stopped at Kevyn’s last night?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Fuck. Does she ever shut up?</span>
    </em>
    <span> “God Lot. What’s with the third degree?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m just making conversation, Natalie. That’s what people do when they eat together.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat rolled her eyes. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Fine, I don’t care anymore. </span>
    </em>
    <span>“I just live in the super shit part of town and I didn’t want to tell you.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh. Ok.” Lottie felt bad. She wanted to keep talking to her, but she could tell Nat was done.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>It wasn’t long before Nat was chugging down the remainder of her juice and milk, as a grand final gesture of her feast. Sated, she let the weight of the previous conversation lift from her shoulders. She leaned back, relaxed, and turned to Lottie.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So how’s the team? How’d they look at conditioning?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smiled at her, happy to be re-engaged. “They’re good.” She was nodding slowly, thinking about what she could share. “Shauna is still fast, Tai is still smart, Van is still funny, and Jackie is still… Jackie.” They both laughed at that. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“And, well, I don’t know. We were all really excited to take the title this year but people </span>
    <em>
      <span>are</span>
    </em>
    <span> talking about how you could ruin it for us.” She wasn’t trying to persuade Nat, but the tension of her missing had been palpable at practice.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Matthews… is that was all of this is? A bribe?” Nat joked, gesturing at the table again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie laughed at her. “No, no, haha! No, it’s just that when I tried to think of recent practices most of what I remember is people talking about you. A few promising girls have comed to conditioning, and tryouts start this week, so maybe we could still do it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie nodded. Half satisfied, half disappointed with Lottie’s optimism. She looked at her, and Lottie gave her a forced smile.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nat, I don’t think you should drop out.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I know that, Lot.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Then why don’t you come back to school?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s already done Lot, I hit my limit. One more missed day and I fail out.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That doesn’t sound done to me. If you wanted to you could go back to class and finish out 160 measly days. Seems like a small price to pay for your diploma, a national title, and maybe a scholarship.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sighed. She wasn’t feeling as combative as the last time they had this conversation in the hall, but no part of her wanted to step foot in that school again.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lot, I just don’t wanna deal with all that. It’s a lot. School </span>
    <em>
      <span>every day</span>
    </em>
    <span>? Practice </span>
    <em>
      <span>every day</span>
    </em>
    <span>? Give me a break, I can’t do that shit.” She looked at Lottie, exhausted from the conversation. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie relented. Placing her napkin on her plate, she started to stand from the table. “Would you like to stay here for a little while? We can watch a movie. I promise not to interrogate you anymore.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat laughed and stood up too. “Sure. What do you got, Lot?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie giggled at her rhyme. “I don’t know. Let’s go to the TV room and see what we have.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>The room was cozier than Nat had expected. With the size of this house, she thought Lottie might’ve been leading her to some kind of at-home theater. Instead it was a relatively small room with a large tv against the wall with a couch, a love seat, and a reliner facing it. The rest of the space in the room was taken up by the surround sound system and shelves of VHS tapes. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Let’s see… Do you want to watch something old, something new, or something weird?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“New and weird.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie took a moment to look through a stack of tapes that seem to have not yet been shelved. “How about this one?” She handed a tape to Nat.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>It still had the cellophane on it, so it was definitely new. Nat read the title, </span>
    <em>
      <span>Interview with a Vampire</span>
    </em>
    <span>. She flipped the case over. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Brad Pitt? Ugh. Tom Cruise. Ughgh. </span>
    </em>
    <span>She read on, trying to give it a chance. She didn’t want to spend too long picking the damn movie. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Good enough.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok, I’m down.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good.” Lottie took the tape from her and started to unwrap it. Nat stood around a little awkwardly, looking over the movie collection. “So who likes movies?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was messing with the VCR player and remotes, trying to get things set up. She answered, distracted, “my mom.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded, and continued to pore over the collection. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stood up from her place in front of the equipment remote in hand. She took a step back, turned on the TV, and changed it to channel 3. Deep blue filled the screen and the TV emitted a low buzzing hum. “Can you get the lights, please, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure.” Nat found the lights by the door.  “Uh, is it this?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, turn the knob. It’s a dimmer.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Wow Lot, can’t even have a normal fucking light switch can ya?” She turned it and the light started to fade. “All the way?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, please. Thank you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After turning the light Nat looked back to where Lottie was now sitting on the couch. The blue glow of the TV made her look hard and pale. She looked like she could be made of marble, or dead. Natalie caught herself staring for a moment too long before she walked towards her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat decided to take her place on the love seat opposite Lottie, facing the TV. After kicking off her tennis shoes, she leaned back against the armrest and brought her legs up to extend over the other cushion.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie watched her. Also illuminated in blue, Nat’s pale skin made her look ethereal. It was Lottie’s turn to stare.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ya Lot?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Can you come sit with me instead?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked at her, unsure what to do. This was more than the flirting she was used to. It was nothing… but what if it wasn’t? </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Sure.” Nat got up and sat back down on the couch with Lottie, but on the opposite side. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Good move Scatorccio.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thanks” Lottie said, and then she turned to press play. “Do you want to watch the coming attractions?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Not really.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie fast-forwarded until she saw “Feature Presentation” show up on the screen. Nat sighed in relief, suddenly happy to not have to talk for a while. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Fucking finally.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>This movie is weird.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Nat was rapt as she watched fires blaze on screen, but then she looked over to Lottie and became equally transfixed. The orange glow of the screen now had the opposite effect of the blue. Lottie looked so warm and soft, so special. Natalie was overcome with the desire to be closer to her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey, Lot?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Can I come sit with you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, please.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Nat turned herself around on the couch and scooted to sit with Lottie. The taller girl raised her arm, inviting Nat to cuddle under it. Nat bent herself and nestled into Lottie’s side. </span><em><span>That was easy.</span></em> <em><span>This feels good.</span></em></p>
  
  <p>
    <span>As the movie played, Natalie felt herself relaxing more and more into Lottie. She was really enjoying the movie, more than she thought she would, and she felt so comfortable in Lottie’s arms. She started to think of other times she’d watched movies like this. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She knew the moves. The guy invites you over to watch a movie, picks which one to put on, sticks his arm out over the top of the couch then looks at you like “well?”. She usually hated the arm move. She would always sit straight so the arm was behind the lower part of her head, awkwardly tilting it forward out of a comfortable position. Then 30 minutes in, the guy would start moving here and there, like he was getting more comfortable, then he’d use that same annoying ass arm to pull you into some gross kiss. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>This wasn’t that. All of a sudden Nat felt herself hoping Lottie wanted to kiss her. She was starting to find it hard to focus on the movie. All Lottie would need to do was bend her head down a little bit and Nat could lean up to her and they’d be kissing. Nat watched it happen over and over in her head, refining the vision with each repetition. She wasn’t watching the movie anymore. She was watching them make out.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Natalie” </span>
    <em>
      <span>Oh my god.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ya Lot?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie whispered to her. “Are you ok? I can feel your heart beating really fast.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, yeah, uh, I…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie was looking down at Nat with her hypnotic, dark eyes. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Oh my god. </span>
    </em>
    <span>“It’s just, um, “ she almost couldn’t find her words as she sunk into them. “Can I kiss you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie held her gaze for a moment longer, then nodded. Nat leaned up and kissed her slowly. </span>
    <em>
      <span>Woah.</span>
    </em>
    <span> Their mouths moved against eachother’s with soft purpose. Natalie felt alight. She moved her hand up to take Lottie’s neck and pull her lower towards her to intensify the kiss. Lottie reacted with a low moan, eliciting a low moan from Nat’s body in return. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Some minutes later, the kiss broke and Lottie smiled down at Nat. She was in a daze, and looking up at Lottie, she let a smile break over her face, too. “Wow” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie giggled at her. “Yeah, wow.” She turned her focus back on the movie.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat took her place in the crook of her arm and felt warm all over. </span>
    <em>
      <span>That felt good.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
