Natalie woke to morning light bleeding through the blinds. The room was silent except for the soft gentle tick of the alarm clock. Lottie was still asleep beside her, breathing slow and even.

Natalie rose smoothly to not wake her. Her body started in on her routine: running clothes, shoes laced, stepping out into the cool, damp air.

Her feet hit pavement in a comfortable rhythm. She kept her eyes forward, breath measured. Her muscles ached from dehydration but she felt the comfortable clarity again, familiar, like something she had forgotten and remembered. 

When she returned, she showered. Soap, rinse, dry. She buckled her watch back onto her wrist as she dressed. She looked to the bed. Lottie was still asleep.

Natalie continued her process and went downstairs to make breakfast. She placed the plates on the table in their places. Poured juice to even levels in each glass. Napkin, fork, knife. Everything in its place.

She sat down, hands folded in her lap, and waited.

The quiet stretched. With nothing to fill it, her mind wandered.

She thought about the game, about the party. About Lottie. Her energy, her excitement. She was different. Her mind went to the feeling of her hand dropping from hers as they entered the party. 

She thought of beer pong. How much fun it was to dominate with Van. She felt warmth at the recent memory. Van's trash talk and confidence. She almost smiled to herself. Then her mind took snapped back to Lottie. The feeling of her hand on her lower back, reconnecting them. 

She remembered the feeling of getting pulled into her again, how good it had felt... like Lottie had brought her back to herself after she'd been adrift. 

<em>I thought you liked when I told you what to do.</em>

She remembered feeling the truth of it echo in her, and repeating it back. Then there had been a dizzyness, something like being too drunk. Like she'd held her breath too long and become lightheaded, then caught her breath again. 

Van's questioning had transpired while she'd been in a haze. She couldn’t remember the words exactly. But she remembered the feeling. Like waking up in the middle of something. Like realizing she’d been standing somewhere, perfectly still, for longer than she meant to.

Natalie looked down at her hands in her lap. The watch strap against her wrist. Her pulse under it. She thought about how good it had felt when Lottie had touched her again after. Like something tight loosening. Like relief.

From there she thought of the comfort she found in the second half of the night, back at her side, tethered. She had been happy there, proud. Lottie was polite to others, but she held onto Nat. Nat was <em>hers</em>, in a way it seemed like others had wanted to be.

A hollow ache opened in her chest. She rose from the table quietly and walked back upstairs. Lottie was still asleep, face turned toward the window. The blankets had fallen slightly off her shoulder. Natalie crossed the room and slid under the covers behind her. She folded her body into Lottie’s from behind, arms wrapping around her waist.

Lottie stirred but didn’t wake. Natalie pressed her face against the back of her shoulder and closed her eyes. She felt the slow rise and fall of Lottie’s breath. The rhythm soothed her, steadied her pulse. It felt correct, like she was a piece back in its place.

<p> </p>

Van stepped out of her trailer just past ten. The sun was high in the sky and she squinted against it. She brought her hand to her forehead and looked towards Nat's trailer. She went over and thought about knocking. She half-raised her hand to but heard the tv behind the door, saw the jalousied window of Nat's room was shut. Her gut said not to bother. Nat wasn’t there. She was definitely still staying at Lottie's.

Van exhaled sharply and started for Kevyn's. She kept her pace quick, letting her restlessness drive the motion in her legs. Her mind looped the events of the past weeks. Nat back at school, Nat at her place. She nodded. <em>All good.</em> Then the new interests, the focus, the calm. It bothered her. It was unsettling. Then last nigth had been a kind of speed run of that same progression. Nat relaxed, greeting her and Tai, making jokes. Then at the beer pong table, smiling, loose and laughing.

And then Lottie.

The way she’d said it. <em>Come on, Nat, I thought you liked when I told you what to do.</em> She hadn't spoken it like a true question or suggestion. She said it like a mantra or imposition. 

The way Nat had answered. Repeating, voice flat, like she wasn’t even there. Like something out of one of a weird movie. <em>The Manchurian Candidate.</em> Like Shaw when he was brainwashed. <em>Yes ma'am.</em> She shivered.

By the time she hit Kevyn’s street, her urgency had doubled over. She knocked once, hard. The door opened too quick.

Kevyn stood there, eyes bloodshot, pupils wide and black. He smelled like beer and sweat, maybe something else under it.

“Van?” He squinted at the sunlight. “Dude, what?”

“You been up all night?” she asked, already stepping past him into the living room.

“Uh…” He scratched at his jaw. “I guess.”

She gave him a once-over, taking in his posture, the slack way he stood. “You look like shit.”

“Thanks.”

Van didn’t waste time. “Listen, we gotta go check on Nat.”

Kevyn frowned, slow like he wasn’t fully processing. “What? Why?”

“Last night, dude. At Jackie's party. It was… weird, Kev. Like she was normal then Lottie did something and she wasn’t right.”

Kevyn leaned back against the wall, eyes half-lidded. “Yeah well. She y'know, gets kinda fucked up sometimes.”

“It wasn’t that. She..." Van’s voice sharpened. "Look, just trust me. We need to see her.”

Kevyn rubbed his face with both hands. “I don’t know, dude...” He looked exhausted.

“Are you good to drive?”

He dropped his hands and sighed. “Yeah. I’m fine.”

Van didn’t buy it, but she wasn’t about to waste more time arguing. “You remember how to get to Lottie's?”

Kevyn pushed off the wall. “Yeah.” He dragged his hand through his hair, already moving toward the door. “Let me grab my shit.”

Kevyn pulled up behind Lottie's car in the driveway. Van stepped out and whistled at the mansion. Big, bright against the clear sky. Too clean. Too quiet. "Jesus..." 

Kevyn trailed after her with a yawn and a rub of his face. "Wait til you see inside, dude."

Van stepped up to the door and knocked, sharp and deliberate.

A few seconds passed before it opened. One of the house staff stood there. Clean white shirt, calm smile. “Can I help you?”

“Yeah.” Van’s voice was casual, but her eyes didn’t waver. “Is Nat here?”

The woman gave a polite nod. “Yes, I believe Miss Natalie is upstairs.” Her tone was smooth. Like it wasn’t strange that they were looking for her here. The woman stepped back, holding the door open. “You can come in.”

Van glanced once at Kevyn before stepping inside.

The house smelled like polish and something fresh from the kitchen. Van’s eyes caught on the kitchen table: two plates set out. Toast, eggs. Juice glasses filled to an even line. Everything untouched. Everything in its place.

Kevyn dropped into a chair, his posture loose and slouched. He grabbed a piece of toast from one of the plates and took a bite, chewing like he hadn’t even noticed how tense Van was.

Van kept standing, arms crossed. Her eyes swept the space. Everything was so... spaced out. The furniture was sparse but tasteful and luxurious. An area rug, a piano, seating. The kitchen was large with nice appliances. 

“Hungry?” Kevyn said around a mouthful of toast.

"No." Van looked back at the food again. Two plates, untouched. Two glasses. She turned to the staff member. "So can we go up or..."

"Please wait here. I'll let Miss Matthews know you're here."


Natalie was working at the desk, her notebook open in front of her, quietly completing a homework assignment. Her mind was steady and the room quiet save for the faint sound of water running in the en suite bathroom.

She heard a soft knock sounded at the bedroom door. Nat paused, pen stilling in her hand. The knock came again, followed by the staff’s deferential, composed voice. “Miss Matthews?”

She rose and crossed the room, hesitating at the door. “There’s a boy and a girl downstairs. They have asked for Miss Natalie.”

Natalie’s pulse ticked up once. Her first instinct was to look over her shoulder, to wait for Lottie to answer instead. But Lottie wasn’t there. She took a quiet breath and forced her voice steady. “Tell them... we’ll come down soon.”

“Of course.” She stepped back and disappeared down the hall.

Her eyes flicked toward the bathroom door and the sound of water still running behind it. Her pulse settled again, slow and quiet. She went back to her desk and waited.

<p> </p>

Natalie followed Lottie downstairs, hand in hers. She stepped behind her precisely, stepping in the the places Lottie's feet left. She felt her heart beat calmly but heard it in her ears, like each beat reverberated through her entire body. She gripped Lottie's hand, grounding herself with the familiar pressure.

When they stepped into the living room, her gaze immediately found Van. She was standing near the kitchen threshold, arms crossed, eyes sharp and steady. Kevyn was slouched at the table, eyes hazy, looking like he’d been up too long, a clean plate in front of him. "Hey Nattie!"

“Miss Matthews” the staff member said quietly.

Lottie’s voice came calm and smooth, as always. “Good morning.”

Natalie didn’t speak yet. She could feel Van’s eyes on her  and her fingers twitched in Lottie's hand.

Van skipped pleasantries. “We came to find Nat.”

Natalie felt the tension coil tighter. Her instinct was to look at Lottie. To wait for Lottie’s voice to answer first, but she felt Van's scrutiny and stayed still, not looking at either one of them.

Lottie’s hand let go and went to her back in a light touch, just steadying.

“Sure, Van. I’ll give you two some space” Lottie started back toward the stairs.

Nat panicked. The prospect of her leaving hit her hard. Her voice left her mouth before she could fully think about it. “No.” She turned and looked at Lottie directly. “I want you to stay.”

Lottie stopped and met Nat's eyes heavily. Natalie felt the connection, the tethering strong, and felt herself slipping into Lottie. She relaxed, the tension in her shoulders dropping. 

Van exhaled sharply, her arms dropping from her chest just long enough to gesture. “Seriously, Nat?” Her voice wasn’t angry exactly, but it had that familiar Van edge. “You can’t talk to me without her in the room?”

Natalie’s chest felt tight in a way she couldn’t quite name. She looked away from Lottie but couldn’t look directly at Van. Confusion started in on her again. 

She knew what Van was seeing, what it must look like from the outside. She also knew how it felt from the inside. The quiet steadiness of Lottie. The way she made sure things settled into their place. She was so good at handling people and Nat didn't trust herself.

Kevyn’s voice broke in from behind, breaking into the mix again. “Van said you got pretty fucked at the party last night Nattie. I think she wanted to make sure you're good.”

Natalie’s fingers twitched again. The comment felt loud in her ears. Disruptive. Out of sync.

“No Kev, I said she was acting weird.” She looked back between Nat and Lottie.

Lottie’s voice came again, even quieter this time, just for Natalie:

“If you want me to stay, baby, I’ll stay.”

Natalie nodded once, the motion small but absolute. Her voice felt steadier when it came:

“Yeah. I want you to stay.”

Van’s eyes flicked between them, brow furrowed. “Fine.” Van said finally, voice clipped. “Then we’re all gonna talk.” 

Nat picked up on her combative tone. She felt Lottie’s hand settle more firmly against her lower back. The weight of it felt like an anchor. Her pulse evened out again as she breathed in slowly through her nose.

Van’s eyes pinned Nat first. “So what happened at the beer pong table?”

Natalie swallowed. Her pulse ticked up again. She tried to consider an answer that didn't include the <em>feeling</em> of Lottie. Some part of her knew that's what Van was getting at and the same part knew it wasn't the explanation she was prepared to give.

“Um…” She glanced at Lottie before she could stop herself.

Van’s voice sharpened. “Don’t look at her. I’m talking to you.”

Natalie’s breath caught. Her mouth felt dry. She looked back at Van. Her voice was small but steady. “Lottie just… pointed out I’d had enough. It was time to give someone else a turn.”

Van’s face hardened. “No. No, Nat." She shook her head. "You wanted to keep playing, and then Lottie made you say you were done.”

Natalie felt the ache behind her face, contorting it. “I was drunk.”

Van exhaled hard, frustrated. Her arms crossed tighter. Her eyes went to Lottie now, sharp as daggers.
“Lottie. I don’t buy it. What did you do to her?"

Natalie felt Lottie’s hand settle firmer against her lower back, steadying her even as Van’s words hit harder. Lottie spoke smooth and calm. “I didn't do anything except tell her she'd had enough."

Nat felt herself nod automatically, pulse slowing with Lottie’s words.

Lottie continued. "She likes it, that I care about her enough to stop her."

Thne Kevyn piped up again, his voice loose and rough but surprisingly sharp.
“Nat doesn’t like being told what to do.”

His words hung awkwardly in the space. Van’s eyebrows lifted and she pointed, exasperated, to him. “See? Even he can tell.” She looked back at Natalie, her eyes going softer, pleading.
“What's going on Nat? You're not... you.”

Natalie’s heart beat louder in her ears, but her body stayed still. She didn’t answer. Her skin felt warm under Lottie’s hand. Grounded. But Van’s words still echoed somewhere underneath.

Natalie’s pulse pressed tight against the strap of her watch. Her throat felt raw, but she forced herself to breathe steady. She thought about what Van had said, and whether it matched the tone she was taking. 

<em>You're not you.</em>

To a point she knew the truth of the statement. She understood the transformation that had taken place. She <em>wasn't</em> just Nat. She was <em>Lottie's</em> Nat. She had seen it that way before and it felt better. She didn't get angry. She didn't fuck up. She was better.

Her voice came quieter than she wanted it to. She wanted to assert it more but it came out meek. “It’s good, Van.” She struggled and remained inarticulate. “Trust me. She helps me, and it… it feels good.”

Van’s mouth pressed into a flat line. Her arms dropped to her sides. “Nat. What the fuck are you talking about?”

But Natalie kept going, louder and clearer.
“I don’t… I don’t always know how to keep myself right.” Her words came halting, like walking uphill. “When she tells me what to do, it’s not...” She shook her head slightly, eyes flicking toward the floor, then back up. “It’s not bad. It makes it easier.”

Van stared at her for a long moment, eyes moving over her face like she was searching for something there. Proof, maybe, that Natalie didn’t really mean it, but she found only truth.

Kevyn just leaned back further in his chair, slouching, eyes drifting upward and speaking, as if he was talking to the ceiling. "I don't know Nattie seemed like life was pretty easy before."

Van shook her head once, low and sharp. “Yeah.” Her voice was rough. “Easier.”

Natalie felt Lottie’s thumb brush gently against her back again. Steady. Quiet.

The silence stretched. Van looked away, jaw clenched, like she’d hit a wall she didn’t know how to get through.

Nat’s pulse slowed again as she relaxed into the steady contact of Lottie’s hand at her back. Van stayed planted, her jaw tight, eyes flicking once from Natalie to Lottie and back again. Like she was waiting for one more opening, but there wasn’t one.

Lottie’s voice broke the quiet, soft but final. “I think we’re done here.” It wasn’t a command. Just a fact.

Van’s mouth twitched—half a grimace, half a smile with no humor in it. “Yeah.” Her voice came out low. She stepped back, hand coming up in a vague half-gesture of surrender. “Fine.”

Her eyes caught Natalie’s once more. Not sharp this time. Tired.

“You know where to find me.”

Lottie dropped her hand from Natalie's back and took her hand. "Thank you for stopping by, Van. come over any time."

"Yeah, whatever. Like I'd want to hang out in this creepy ass house." She didn't opt for feigned friendliness. "Come on Kev, let's get out of here." 

He rose and followed her. "By Nattie" He gave a deflated wave.

Natalie stayed standing beside Lottie, the echo of Van’s words lingering in the air. Lottie leaned in just slightly, her voice warm against her ear. “Good girl.”

Natalie exhaled, slow and steady, letting the relief wash through her as the front door clicked shut behind them.

The quiet that followed felt heavier than before, like the whole house had exhaled along with her. Lottie’s hand traced lightly along her back again, then up to her shoulder. Her voice stayed soft. “You did so well, baby.”

Natalie nodded once, the motion small and sure. Her throat felt full with a lump.

Lottie stepped in front of her, both hands now resting at Natalie’s waist, eyes boring into her. “How do you feel?”

Natalie swallowed. She felt the soothing pleasure wash over her, relaxing her even more.“Good.”

“Good.” Lottie’s smile was calm again, that smooth steadiness that always made everything slot into place. “They didn’t upset you too much?”

Natalie shook her head slowly and looked away. “No. Not really.” She meant it. It wasn’t like before, in the earlier days. The sensation was clarifying, not hazy. Familiar, not inexplicable.

“I just… I didn’t like the way Van looked at me. It was... I don't know. Like something was bad. Even though I said it was good. Like I made it worse.”

Lottie’s hands squeezed lightly at her sides. “You don’t have to worry about Van, baby. You know what’s right for you.”

Natalie’s eyes looked up to meet hers again. That was true. She did know.

Lottie tilted her head, voice dropping quieter still. “Come upstairs. Let’s lie down for a little while.”

“Yes Lottie.”

Lottie led her up the stairs slowly, hand in hers. With each step, Natalie felt the pressure in her chest ease. The house below them... Van’s voice, Kevyn’s weight slouched against the kitchen table... all of it felt farther away now, like a scene from a movie she wasn’t in anymore.

By the time they reached the bedroom, she was calm again, relaxed. Lottie let go of her hand to close the door behind them. The click of it sounded final in a way Natalie found comforting.

Lottie sat on the bed and patted her leg. “Come here”. Natalie crossed to her knelt, placing her hands on Lottie's knee and resting her head pon them. She looked up at her, waiting.

“You really did so well, baby.” Lottie murmured again, stroking her hair. “But I want to hear you say how you feel. That wasn't easy.”

Natalie breathed in slowly. Her hands settled on Lottie’s shoulders like an anchor. “Good. Better.” Her voice was soft, sure. “It feels... easier now. With them gone.”

Lottie’s eyes stayed on hers. She traced her thumbs lightly along Natalie’s temple. “Were you scared, while they were here?”

Natalie’s jaw flexed. Her breath caught a little. “A little. When you almost left. I... I didn’t want to say the wrong thing.”

Lottie nodded and added gently. “And you didn’t.”

Natalie shook her head. “I didn’t.”

Lottie tilted her head, reading her face. “Do you remember what Van said? About not being yourself?”

Natalie’s stomach fluttered, but not like panic. Like weightlessness. “Yeah.”

“How do you feel about that?”

Natalie thought for a long moment. She felt the shape of Lottie’s hand steady on her. She glanced down at her wrist, the watch snug against her skin. “I don’t know if I was... ever really sure what that meant. Before. I don't know who I was.”

Lottie smiled, small but bright, like that was exactly the answer she wanted. Natalie looked back at her again, voice quieter. “I just feel like the me that needs to be with you. Like yours.”

Lottie’s hand cupped her face gently. “You're so special to me. I feel like the me that needs you too.”

Natalie closed her eyes for a second. The relief in her chest felt warm and quiet. Being alone with Lottie again felt like stepping back into the right place. She let out a slow breath as Lottie pulled her down beside her on the bed.

They lay back together, Natalie folding into her.
