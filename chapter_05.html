  <p>After getting through the school day and practice, Natalie felt complete and at ease in Lottie’s car. She looked around, trying to see if she could deduce more about the ride home from Kevyn's. Then she saw it in the car door: a plastic water bottle. The water bottle Lottie had brought for her. The memory reformed in her mind clearly at that moment. Her panic, Lottie’s admonishments, her ranted confession of overdoing the binge. The headache, the nosebleed, the tears. She put her face in her hands and groaned. She wished she hadn’t tried so hard to remember such a painful moment.</p>

  <p>“What is it?” Lottie saw her distress.</p>
  
  <p>“I was just thinking about when you picked me up from Kevyn’s.” Nat didn’t look at her. She felt ashamed.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh… well… it’s ok Natalie. That’s all over now.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat shook her head. She wasn’t so sure. She knew herself. She knew how easily she acted on impulse. In her gut she felt like it could happen again. She could endure much in pursuit of a good high, and when she was in that place it was easy to not think about how painful it could be afterward.</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t know Lot.”</p>
  
  <p>“What do you mean you <em> don’t know </em>? Why would you do that to yourself again?”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s hard to explain.” Nat looked for the words to make Lottie understand.</p>
  
  <p>“It’s like once it’s in front of me, it <em> has to happen </em> . And when it’s not in front of me, it’s the first thing I want to find. It’s almost like there’s a second version of me in my head and she’s a <em> fiend </em>. Then when it does happen it feels so good, and everything feels so perfect, I don’t care if I’m fucking myself up. And the more I do it, the easier it gets to do even more.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie was silent. </p>
  
  <p>Nat looked out the window and contemplated what she’d just said. She’d never thought about it like that before, that it wasn’t her own will that got her drugs. She thought about Kevyn and his cousin. If his cousin brought it then Kevyn had it, if Kevyn had it, Nat could get it. The realization hit her hard: she hadn’t been making any choices at all. She was just… an <em> addict </em>.</p>
  
  <p>She started to cry.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie pulled up the drive. She killed the engine and sat for a moment looking at the crying girl. “Natalie, are you ok?”</p>
  
  <p>Her tenderness only intensified Nat’s crying. A lump formed in her throat as it grew into a full sob.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie took her hand. “Come on, let’s go inside.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie moved slowly, trying to get ahold of herself. Lottie went to the trunk and gathered both her and Natalie’s things, and went to the door.</p>
  
  <p>Following behind her, Nat asked, “Hey Lot, am I stupid?”</p>
  
  <p>“No Natalie, I think you’re very smart. You just have gotten yourself into a bad situation by doing stupid things.” </p>
  
  <p>That didn’t make Nat feel any better. <em> At least she didn’t say yes. </em></p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Once inside, Lottie led Nat up to her room and sat down on the bed. Nat looked around wide eyed at the spacious room. Her bed looked plush and comfortable and there were photos adorning the walls and surfaces. She had lamps that lit the room warmly and a desk illuminated by a window. There were two doors in the room, Nat assumed a closet and a bathroom. Nat estimated the room was probably the size of her trailer.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie patted the spot next to her as an invitation to sit down. Nat did and immediately leaned on Lottie, exhausted from the day. Lottie took her hand, interlacing their fingers.</p>
  
  <p>They sat like that for a long time.</p>
  
  <p>Then Lottie turned her head and kissed the top of Nat’s and said, “I know it might seem like it’ll be hard right now, but I think you’ll feel a lot better after we do some school work.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat groaned and buried her face into the crook of Lottie’s arm. “I don’t want to.”</p>
  
  <p>“Natalie, would you trust me on this? Please?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat sat up and looked at her. Lottie looked back, holding her gaze. “Ok”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled at her. “Ok, why don’t you get your backpack?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie nodded and silently rose to retrieve her bag. She sat back down on the bed, opened it, and then dramatically turned it upside down, letting the papers scatter.</p>
  
  <p>Next, Lottie stood up and went to her desk to retrieve some items: 3 folders, a 5-subject notebook, a pack of notecards, a marker, a pen, and a pencil.</p>
  
  <p>“Ok Natalie” She started, holding the supplies and staring down at the new mess on her bed. “First get all of the papers into piles according to class, please.” </p>
  
  <p>As Natalie complied, Lottie took the marker and wrote on each of the folders: <em> To Do, Doing, Done </em></p>
  
  <p>Then she took out the 5-subject notebook and turned to the first manila divider. “Now I know your first period is English” she wrote <em> English </em>.</p>
  
  <p>“What’s your second period?” “Trig” Lottie turned to the second divider. <em> Trig </em>. </p>
  
  <p>“Third?” “Spanish” <em> Spanish. </em></p>
  
  <p>“Fourth?” “Computer Applications” “Ok well there’s only five sections so we’ll skip that one for now and skip health too. You probably won’t need to take notes for that either.</p>
  
  <p>“So, sixth hour?” “Physical Science” <em> Physical Science </em></p>
  
  <p>“And seventh?” “World History” <em> World History. </em></p>
  
  <p>“Ok so now you have three folders and a notebook. This will make things a lot easier for you.” She handed them to Nat.</p>
  
  <p>The term “school supplies” had always seemed kind of like a joke to her. She never needed <em> supplies </em> for <em> school </em>. Holding them in her hands made her feel like an imposter. </p>
  
  <p>“Lot, I don’t need all this. It’s too much.”</p>
  
  <p>“Natalie, this is basically the bare minimum. Do you have the list of assignments you need to make up?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie handed her what she had written on the paper Mr. O’Neill had given her.</p>
  
  <p> </p><ol>
  <li><em>Vocab list defs Quiz next Tuesday</em></li>
  <li><em>personal essay 500 words</em></li>
  <li><em>What I did this summer (espanol)- 2 paragraphs</em></li>
  <li><em>preterite tense Quiz make-up this week</em></li>
  <li><em>hardware vs. software 1 paragraph, written, then typed. turn in on floppy disk</em></li>
  <li><em>Make up essay: egypt vs. mesopotamia. Money, government, +1 subject</em></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Lottie reviewed it then looked at her. “That’s it?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie scoffed. “That’s it? That’s <em> a lot </em>. And no, that’s not it. I didn’t write anything down in Math because I got distracted by Van, and I didn’t write down anything about the worksheets because… obviously”</p>
  
  <p>“What do you have to do for math?”</p>
  
  <p>“There are these worksheets,” she gestured to the first sorted pile, “plus this weird circle thing I have to fill in, and then a quiz on the weird circle thing that I have to take as soon as I feel ready”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie nodded. “Ok. Let’s pick two things to try to do today. Then we’ll put everything else, including your list, in the <em> To Do </em> folder.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat contorted her face and threw her head back. “<em> Two </em> things? Are you insane? It’s going to be night soon.” </p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her seriously. “Stop being dramatic. Start with the two easiest things and then go from there. It won’t be hard to finish them, then you can cross them off your list and it’ll make you feel better.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie considered what she said and she decided she wanted Lottie to be right. She wanted to listen to her. “How do I know what will be the easiest?”</p>
  
  <p>“Well, vocab definitions are easy because you just have to look them up and copy them. For the second thing, I’d probably pick the personal essay because it’s easy to write about myself, or maybe the unit circle because just like the vocab you just need to copy it from a book.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat didn’t want to write about herself right then. “Ok. Vocab and Circle.”</p>
  
  <p>“Very good. Ok” Lottie gathered the rest of the materials and put them in the <em> To Do </em> folder. “From now on, when you get a new assignment, either write it on this sheet with the due date, or put the worksheet in the folder with the due date written on the top. Ok?”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.” Natalie took the folder and looked at it. The papers that moments ago comprised a mess on the bed, were now neatly held in its pockets. She felt the difference between the unmanageable mess and the to-do list. She felt relieved.</p>
  
  <p>“Come on, you can work at my desk.” </p>
  
  <p>Lottie got up and Natalie followed. Lottie took the dictionary from its place on the desk and pulled a fresh sheet of lined paper from the drawer. She took a pencil from the cup and directed her, “Look up each word on the list, and write at least two definitions. I think it helps to write the definitions in my own words after reading instead of copying word-for-word. It’ll help when you need to study.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie nodded and began. <em> 1. Aberration: </em></p>
  
  <p>“Don’t forget to write your name on your paper.” Natalie complied.</p>
  
  <p>Behind her, Lottie went to her stereo and put on some quiet classical music and then went to her backpack and retrieved an assignment of her own. They worked like that for about an hour. </p>
  
  <p>Natalie felt soothed by the atmosphere. Her mind was on the task, on reading and synthesizing the definitions. Not once did her mind wander. She also liked the music. She liked the way it filled in the gaps in her mind without being intrusive. It stood like a barrier against distraction, improving her focus. She also liked the feeling of studying <em> with Lottie </em>.</p>
  
  <p>When she finished she looked over the completed list in front of her, impressed with herself. Her handwriting wasn’t pretty like Lottie’s was, but it was <em> hers. </em> It wasn’t rushed like it had been copied minutes before class, not sloppily done without care. It was evidence of her effort, and it was of respectable quality. <em> Nice. </em></p>
  
  <p>She took the sheet and got up and put it in her new <em> Done </em> folder. She felt satisfaction wash over here. Incredibly, she felt excited at the thought of doing it again.</p>
  
  <p>“Hey Lot, I’m done with the vocab words.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked up from her place on the bed. “Good job Nat. That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie laughed nervously “No… I mean… it was kinda cool.” She looked away sheepishly, embarrassed by her nerdiness.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie laughed. “You’re cute when you’re acting like a nerd.” She got up and walked over to Natalie. “I think you’ve earned a reward.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie looked up at her and smiled as Lottie bent down and took her into a deep kiss. <em> Wow. </em>She felt the rich, layered sensation of her sharpened mind melting against the hot intensity of Lottie on her mouth. Nat kissed hungrily, desperately. With her hands on her neck, she pulled herself into the taller girl again. She could hear the piece that played crescendo towards its climax. </p>
  
  <p>Lotties hands found the hem of her shirt and slipped beneath to hold Nat’s bare skin. Then the taller girl broke the kiss and left a trail of sloppy kisses behind the blonde’s ear and down her neck. Nat felt as though she were in a wild dream. Her heart raced as she felt Lottie’s hands drop from her back and slip to her shorts, reaching beneath the waist band to massage her ass.</p>
  
  <p>Nat moaned. </p>
  
  <p>“Too much?” Lottie brought her hands to Nat’s hips and smiled down at her.</p>
  
  <p>“Ummmm” Nat wasn’t yet ready to use words.</p>
  
  <p>“Ok breaks over” Lottie kissed Nat’s forehead. </p>
  
  <p>Nat let out a pathetic whine.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, baby makes out for thirty seconds and now she can’t do her homework? Guess there won’t be any more kiss breaks.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat took her seriously. “No no it’s fine. I’m fine. I just uh… need a minute.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok. I’ll be right back”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie left and returned a few minutes later with a volume from her encyclopedia. She opened the book and turned to the entry on Trigonometry. Then she went into her closet and retrieved a three-ring binder. She grabbed a tab in the middle and flipped through the section until she found what she was looking for. Natalie saw it, too. It was the circle she had to complete, filled in an annotated colorfully and neatly. <em> How did she make a circle look so pretty? </em></p>
  
  <p>Nat thought of Van’s “abstract art” and shook her head in wonder. That wasn’t even half as special as what was before her. The circle circumscribed three rectangles in three colors. The circle had a large black cross sectioning it into four equal parts, and each rectangle had an X connected its vertices. Each vertex met the circumference of the circle at a point, denoted with 3 values. It looked complex and simple all at once. Nat was stunned. “Did you draw that?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes. It’s my unit circle.”</p>
  
  <p>“What do I do with it?”</p>
  
  <p>“You have to make your own. That’s the assignment. Fill it out with the circle she gave you, and then you’ll probably have to do it again for the quiz from memory.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat was incredulous. That couldn’t possibly be true. “And how the fuck am I supposed to do that?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie opened the desk drawer and pulled out a ruler and a protractor. “Use these.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie took the instruments in her hands and investigated them. She looked at Lottie for more direction. </p>
  
  <p>“You can use the article in the encyclopedia on Trig. I don’t have a Trig textbook here, so this is the best I can do without sitting and explaining it to you directly. It’s really not as complex as it looks and I think you can figure it out. If not, we can call it quits for tonight and you can go to the library at school to find a better book there. But try for at least an hour, please?”</p>
  
  <p>“Can we make out some more after an hour?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie laughed at her. “Yes”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie smiled at her and nodded. “Ok”</p>
  
  <p>She began to read and Lottie went back to her own studies.</p>
  
  <p>When Lottie finished her work, she looked up to see Natalie engrossed. She was in her own world, systematically rotating the sheet, marking positions with the protractor, and drawing straight connecting lines with the ruler. Lottie got up and turned on the desk lamp for her and left the room, leaving Natalie alone to finish.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie made dinner and set the table, then went back to the room to check on Natalie. She found her still hard at work, focused and moving purposefully. Lottie went to stand behind her and gasped when she saw that Natalie was working dutifully not on the unit circle worksheet, but on the fifth unit circle, drawn on a blank sheet of paper. The original assignment and 3 more completed circles stacked neatly on the edge of the desk.</p>
  
  <p>“Natalie!”</p>
  
  <p>Nat stopped, as if broken from a trance. “Wuh… what? What’s wrong?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie took the stack of finished versions in her hands and admired them. Each one was more perfect than the last. “Why did you do so many?”</p>
  
  <p>“I, uh, well. I don’t know. I did the first one and when I was done I thought I could do it better. So then I found a compass in your drawer and I traced the worksheet and tried again. Then when I finished that one I had the same feeling, so I tried again. And then again. Has it been an hour yet?”</p>
  
  <p>“Nat, it’s been three and a half hours. It’s almost 11. You looked like you were working so hard I didn’t want to stop you, but it’s getting late.”</p>
  
  <p>“3 and a half hours? No way. I… “ she looked out the window and saw it had gotten dark and saw the lamp by which she was working. “I didn’t realize.”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s ok Nat. Come down stairs so we can eat.”</p>
  
  <p>“Aren’t you forgetting something?” Nat grinned.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie gave her a wide smile and gave her a chaste kiss on the lips. “Come on. I’m hungry.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>They went together downstairs into the kitchen where Lottie had left two bowls of chicken rice casserole. Nat felt the pain of hunger in her stomach when she saw the food so she sat down and started eating.</p>
  
  <p>“It’s probably a little cold now so you don’t have to rush.” Lottie commented pointedly.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie picked up on her tone and looked at her. “What?”</p>
  
  <p>“Nat, I made dinner for us then waited for you to finish working before I started eating, and then you just sat down and started without waiting for me. That wasn't very nice.”</p>
  
  <p>She put down her fork and swallowed. “I’m sorry Lottie. I’ll wait for you.”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Natalie.” Lottie took her place at the table and took her fork in hand. She looked at Nat and nodded. “Bon Appetit”</p>
  
  <p>They ate in silence.</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you for dinner Lottie.”</p>
  
  <p>“You’re welcome Natalie.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>When they finished their food, Lottie led Natalie out the back door to a small sitting area. She produced a pack of cigarettes, lit one in her mouth and passed it to Natalie before lighting her own. They sat together for a moment, smoking in silence.</p>
  
  <p>“Do you want me to take you home?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. I like to be here with you.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok. I want to play the piano before bed. Would that be ok? Or do you want to go to bed now?”</p>
  
  <p>“You play piano?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes Natalie”</p>
  
  <p>“That sounds good.”</p>
  
  <p>Soon they were back in their places in the living room, Nat on the divan and Lottie at the piano. Each note resounded through the large room, warm and velvety, filling every corner. Nat felt herself become pleasantly relaxed as the harmony massaged her exhausted mind. </p>
  
  <p>She’d been listening to classical music on the stereo all evening as she worked, but this was next level. Something about being in the same space as the instrument that produced such beautiful sounds. I made her feel as though she were in a dream.</p>
  
  <p>After playing a few songs Lottie came over to where Nat lounged. She kneeled in front of her and kissed her gently. “It’s almost midnight. Do you want to come to bed?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat gave a weak nod. She was tired and ready to go to sleep.</p>
  
  <p>Back up in Lottie’s room, Lottie retrieved clothes from her closet for Nat to change into.</p>
  
  <p>“Can I take a shower too?” Nat asked. She didn’t want to surprise Lottie when she turned on the water.</p>
  
  <p>“Of course. Please do.”</p>
  
  <p>As Nat showered and dressed for bed in the bathroom, Lottie took one of her circles from the desk and pinned it to her cork board. She took the original worksheet, wrote Nat’s name on it, and put it in the <em> Done </em>folder. She put Nat’s things in her backpack, and then worked to put the desk back in order.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie emerged from the bathroom looking refreshed. “You’re turn”</p>
  
  <p>“Thank you Natalie.” Lottie went to her closet for clothes and then went into the bathroom.</p>
  
  <p>When Lottie came back out she found Nat asleep in bed. Lottie got in and wrapped herself around her from behind, draping her arms over her waist. “Good night Natalie”</p>
  
  <p>“Good night Lot”</p>
