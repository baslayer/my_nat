  <p>
    <span>On her run the next morning, Nat let herself dwell on the day before. The effect of her servitude lingered with her, and the high of the run acted as a lens enhancing her feelings in hindsight. The endorphins put her in a place of euphoria and made her feel proudly devoted. She found herself eager to begin another day full of opportunities to do things for Lottie, to please her. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she got back to the bedroom, Lottie was in the shower. While she waited, she prepared the bags and then sat at the desk to wait for her turn.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning Natalie” Lottie was back in her towel, gathering her long hair to the side.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good morning Lottie” she paused and watched as Lottie gracefully walked to the closet, her long legs padding along weightlessly. “You’re so pretty.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Mmm. Thank you, honey. How was your run?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It was good, thank you. I wish you could’ve been there with me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh? Well I’ll join you </span>
    <em>
      <span>de temps en temps</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Today I was a little slow out of bed.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Of course, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What will you make for breakfast today?” She spoke to Nat from inside the closet.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, um. I don’t know.” Nat paused and searched for the right answer. “What would you like me to make?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“How about some yogurt and fruit today?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie. That’s a good idea. Thank you.” She was fixed to the desk staring expectantly at the closet door. “Is it ok if I use the bathroom now?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, go ahead.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat showered, dressed, and went downstairs to prepare the breakfast Lottie requested. She set the table with affection, performing every task as an act of devotion. When the food was out and the places were set, she pored over the table, searching for details to improve upon.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Lottie came down, she approached Natalie from behind and took her by the shoulders and rested her chin atop her head. “Breakfast looks delicious, baby. Thank you.” She bent to kiss her on the cheek.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt the compliment like the first bite of an appetizer to a meal; it ignited an intense hunger in her for more praise. “You’re welcome Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They sat and began to eat. “I saw you packed the bags already, too. Thank you” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat kept her focus on Lottie. She watched as she ate, noted which fruits she preferred, and made sure to eat the pieces of fruits she neglected.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She noticed when Lottie slowed and her expression changed to one of contemplation. “What is it, Lottie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Excuse me?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You look like you’re thinking about something. Is there anything I can do?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, Nat, um… not really.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie was disappointed. “Are you sure?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you ok, Natalie?” Lottie cast her gaze down, face slightly contorted in concern.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m so good. Thank you Lottie. Are you ok?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Have you thought about last night?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sat up straight as she went over the events in her head. “Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It wasn’t… too much for you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked down at her plate and considered the question. There were a couple </span>
    <em>
      <span>its</span>
    </em>
    <span> Lottie could be referring to and she hadn’t considered either one </span>
    <em>
      <span>too much</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Something in her wanted Lottie to name </span>
    <em>
      <span>it</span>
    </em>
    <span> so that she could affirm her own pleasure from it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie shifted in her seat. “Well I guess first is the way I… ate you. I’ve never done that before but the way you looked… I just… I don’t know. It made me feel… hungry. I didn’t know I was going to do that. Are you ok?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat’s head swam with the implication of the confession. The notion of making Lottie feel overwhelmed with need made her head spin with arousal. “Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“And the, uh, the rest of it? Did you like it? Or were you just like, doing what I told you to do?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie. I liked it.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you just saying that, because you think it’s what I want you to say?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt the mental strain of contradiction pulling at the edges of her consciousness. “Lottie… I… I like it. I like it </span>
    <em>
      <span>because</span>
    </em>
    <span> it’s what you want. It feels so good doing what you say. It’s the only thing I want.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie shook her head. “Nat…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lottie, please. I don’t want to try to make sense of this again.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What if I didn’t want you to do what I said.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’d say you’re lying.” Lottie looked at her directly then, as if Nat had said aloud something she was fighting admitting to herself.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat caught her gaze and tried to look past the conflicted expression in her girlfriend. She searched, trying to read her, but instead felt the pull of her gaze. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked away. “Nat, not right now.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m trying to talk to you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You don’t like it when I look at you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, I…” She looked back at Nat, her expression curious and her gaze unfocused. “What does it feel like?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked at her directly, and searched behind her eyes again. “What?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“When you look at me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lottie… I don’t know.” She held her eyes on Lottie, trying to feel the pull. “Sometimes it’s like a slow… pull. But sometimes it’s like quicksand. And it… it’s nice. I want it. When I feel it happening… like now… I like the feeling.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then Lottie focused on Nat’s searching eyes. “What does it feel like now?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie watched as Nat’s embattled expression melted into peace. She held her gaze and pushed Nat deeper. “Tell me Nat.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat struggled as words began to evaporate from her head. “What… what do you… want me… to say?” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Tell me it’s going to be ok.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“It’s going to be ok.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I make you happy, right Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“You make me happy.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So good for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“So good for you.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie stood from her place and went to stand over the sitting girl. She held Nat’s head against her torso as she stroked her hair. “I love you, Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat’s mind fizzed as the affection entered her emptied head. “I love you too, Lottie.” She felt the full emotion of the phrase as it passed over her lips. “I love you so much.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s good Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They stood like that for a moment, each of them savoring the respective feelings of holding and being held.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat pulled away and looked up to Lottie. “Did you like breakfast?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked down into her. “Yes, it was perfect. You did very well. So good for me”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie looked deep into Lottie to feel the heady mix of being praised and pulled. “Thank you Lottie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie allowed the day to progress in the same fashion as the previous. When the homeroom bell rang, Nat rose from her desk to make room for Lottie. “You don’t think you have time to walk me to building 1, do you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, Natalie, I think you’ll have to go on your own.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok.” Nat made no effort to conceal her disappointment. “I’ll miss you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’ll miss you too, baby. Don’t get into any fights. I want to see you at lunch.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie realized she didn’t know where to look for Lottie after class in the event that she didn’t have detention. “Oh, um, where do you sit?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I usually eat with some of the girls in the courtyard then I like to smoke by the softball fields after I eat.” She directed Natalie where to wait for her. “Do you want me to get you a lunch?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie. Thank you.” She kissed her and left.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When she got to Spanish she made an effort to not look at Kevyn. The memory of their encounter lingered with her and she wanted to be able to please Lottie by not getting into another confrontation with him. Despite her effort, when she sat down Kevyn got up and took the seat behind her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hey Nattie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She didn’t acknowledge him.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Nat </span>
    <em>
      <span>I’m sorry</span>
    </em>
    <span>. Come on.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She spoke without looking at him. “Leave me alone, Kev.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Aw come on, don’t be like that. I was just being dumb. I miss you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat sighed at the hurt in his voice and turned to face him. “It’s ok Kev”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thanks Nattie, that’s cool.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She turned back around but he went on. “So, uh, wanna hang out later?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie stifled an urge to insult him. “No.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Is it ‘cause you’re busy?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Are you gonna hang out with that girl again?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh. Um. That’s cool dude.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She turned around again to look at him “Don’t ever fucking say shit to anyone about her.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Totally, dude. I got you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After class, Nat went to the spot Lottie specified in the courtyard. She took out some Spanish homework and worked while she waited. Soon she saw Lottie approaching with a group of their teammates. She rose and took the tray of food from her. “Thank you Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re welcome Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She waited until Lottie sat down before sitting again. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s like I’m seeing a celebrity in the wild.” Van teased Nat. “What’s it like, eating lunch with the commoners?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She stuck her tongue out at Van. “Well, if my queen wants me here…”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, wow, Nat. Laying it on a bit thick, don’t ya think?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie came to her defense. “She’s just doing what I asked. It’s not her fault.” She said it with an airiness that was too light to be jest.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van took the remark as bait. “So Nat, do you do </span>
    <em>
      <span>everything</span>
    </em>
    <span> Lottie asks?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Mari jumped in. “Can we please just shut the fuck up about Lottie and Nat? It’s like everyday with you guys.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked at Lottie with a silent question, and she returned with silent direction to let it go.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Tai answered. “Mari’s right. It’s their business.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van nodded in feigned agreement. “And now that Nat’s here it doesn’t even count as gossip.” She waited for Nat to return with a smart-ass remark, but none came.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>It’d been a long time since Nat had been to lunch at school and she was not practiced in the social dynamics at play. Instead of trying to balance between conversations and varied stimuli, she stayed focused on Lottie and only spoke when she prompted her to. She watched as Lottie picked at her food and laughed when people made jokes. She smiled at her and rested her head on her shoulder, and did not concern herself with appearances.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Come one Nat, it’s time to go smoke.” Nat rose with her tray. “Are you guys coming too?” She looked at Van and Tai.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah we’ll be right behind you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat followed Lottie to return the trays then to the softball field. Lottie took the cigarettes from her bag and lit one in her mouth then passed it to Nat before lighting her own. They smoked in silence for a moment, enjoying the feeling of a charge building between them away from the others.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So, was Kevyn in class?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked up at the taller girl “Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Everything alright? No fights?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat smiled at having successfully fulfilled Lottie’s direction. “No, no fights.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s my good girl.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat stepped closer to her. “Thank you Lottie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie’s breath shifted and she reached for Nat. Her fingers gently traced her jawline, then became firm when she reached her chin, pulling her into a kiss. Nat’s lips moved with urgency, eager to worship the girl kissing her. Lottie’s tongue reached hers, not searching but demanding. Nat felt as though she were being led in a dance, and followed with utter devotion that made her head swim with pleasure.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Break it up, break it up,” Van yelled from a distance.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie separated them but held Nat’s gaze. “Time to talk to people.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat nodded.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What’s up lesbos?” Van pulled out a pack from her bag and started hammering it on the back of her hand.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie laughed and turned to face her. “Just having a smoke.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van turned to face Nat. “So we were talking and Tai says she’s got some free time this weekend. You guys wanna hang out again?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked to Lottie “Yeah, uh, I was talking to Van in trig yesterday and we were thinking we could all hang out soon.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie nodded at her “That sounds like fun. What were you thinking?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well I’m busy on Saturday, so how about Sunday? There’s a movie I’ve been wanting to see and they’re still showing it at the twin.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Sunday movie. We watch movies on Sundays. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van watched as a look of confusion spread across Nat’s face. “Is that cool, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie answered for her. “Should work out just fine. We can come pick you up. Nat will probably have to get more of her stuff from her place so it’ll work out.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Tai looked at her then “Her stuff? Is she staying with you?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh, yeah. I mean, she asked if she could and it’s really nice having some company.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van understood why Nat would rather not be at home, but knew Tai didn’t know. She changed the subject back to the plans. “That’s nice of you Lot, but I think Tai will pick me up, right?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah we’ll meet you guys there. We’ll figure out which show and let you know. Remind us at the diner tomorrow if we forget.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Tai stood to the side as the three of them smoked, letting the smoke billow past her. She watched Lottie and Nat and observed their affectionate body language, the way Nat moved as if she were connected by strings, moving in time with Lottie. She felt a pang of jealousy but then corrected herself. “You guys are really cute.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Van looked at her in shock. “Yeah if you think puppet shows are cute. Hey Nat, when’s your audition for Pee Wee’s Playhouse?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat spoke for the first time since explaining the half-plans to Lottie. “What?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ah, she speaks!”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie glared at Van. “Be nice. Lunch was a lot for her. She’s used to sitting in silence for 30 minutes in the middle of the day.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Was it a lot for you, Nat? School lunch table too stimulating?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Uh, yeah. It was a lot.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well, that’s new.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>A silence fell over them that was eventually broken by the bell. Lottie looked at Nat and prodded her to motion. “Come on, time for health class.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>At the end of the school day, Lottie reminded Nat she should go get books from the library for her world history assignment. She walked her there and helped her find the appropriate texts to borrow before walking her to the trig room.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>After practice, they went back home and Nat got to work on the essay. When she finished she asked Lottie to review it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I don’t know Natalie. I have a lot of homework of my own. Why don’t you go make dinner?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>As they ate, the Lottie raised the topic of lunch. “How did you like coming to lunch today?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, Lot. I wasn’t really paying attention.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, I think that’s the problem.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat raised her head and looked at Lottie. “What’s wrong? What did I do?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her sympathetically. “It’s not so much what you did, it’s what you didn’t do. You hardly spoke to anyone.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m sorry Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s ok Nat. It’s just that… I think people notice.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Notice what?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That you’re so… focused on me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Oh.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yeah, and I mean, I’m ok with it. I even, you know, </span>
    <em>
      <span>really</span>
    </em>
    <span> like it. But, um, I’m worried.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“About what people will say.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, exactly.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What do you want me to do, Lottie? I don’t want to talk to any of them.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well, maybe we shouldn’t go to lunch together.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt it like a slap to the face. “You don’t want me around?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“No, no that’s not it at all. I love being with you. It’s just… people.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt herself getting upset. “Fuck people. We don’t gotta sit with them.” </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her, and tried to impart calm onto her. “Ok Nat. We can eat alone at lunch.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat looked into Lottie and felt the soothing feeling seep into her. “Thank you Lottie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>While they smoked Nat broached the topic that had been on her mind all day.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So, Lot, do you wanna um, do something tonight?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie smirked and gave her a side-eye “What would you like to do, Nat?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt blood rush to her cheeks as she thought of a way to ask for what she wanted. “I was thinking we could, uh, try something else.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“What would you like to try?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Well, um, I was thinking about this morning and well…” Nat tried to put together a coherent request. “Remember last week, when we were in my room and you, um, kinda sent me somewhere?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie nodded slowly. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“So um, I was thinking, maybe we could try that again?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie looked at her directly. “You want to do it </span>
    <em>
      <span>again</span>
    </em>
    <span>?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat gulped as she tried to sink into her eyes “Yes, Lottie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie bore into her with intention, quickly sinking her deep.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie, I want you to go upstairs.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Go upstairs”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Go to the bedroom, take a shower.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Go to the bedroom, take a shower.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“When you’re done, don’t get dressed. Just wait for me on the bed.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Wait for you on the bed.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Very good Natalie. Good girl.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>A smile peaked through Nat’s dazed expression as the praise washed over her.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Now Natalie, I want you to stay here, in this place.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Stay here”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Don’t wake up.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Don’t wake up.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok Natalie, go upstairs.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat rose from the table, limbs moving according to the directions echoing in her head. Without awareness or agency, she executed the steps given to her by Lottie, as if the words themselves were firing the neurons required to signal movement in her muscles. When she was done she sat on the edge of the bed, hands in her lap and eyes forward.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>When Lottie finished with her shower she did not dress either. She approached the sitting girl, bent to look into her empty gaze, and pushed her hair behind her ear.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“How do you feel Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She saw Nat’s eyes gain some awareness and focus on hers. </span>
    <em>
      <span>“Lottie.”</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Natalie, I’m here with you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She stayed fixed on Lottie, awaiting direction.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie got onto the bed and slid so she was sitting behind Natalie, near the headboard.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok Natalie, turn around.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>She did.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“We’re going to try something new, ok, Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Try something new.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I’m going to wake you but you will stay under my control.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Stay under your control.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You will have your mind, but not your body.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Not my body.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“When I do something, you will do the same thing.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>“Do the same thing.”</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Ok, Natalie” She gave her a kiss before leaning back again. “Wake up for me.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat came to and saw Lottie naked before her with her legs folded, sitting on her ankles. She was looking at her, expectantly. She felt the emptiness of her head and the gap in time missing since she’d been at the table. She found herself showered, but not dressed. She tried to move herself closer to the girl in front of her but couldn’t. “</span>
    <em>
      <span>Lottie</span>
    </em>
    <span>”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Hi Natalie, how do you feel?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie looked to Lottie and tried to come up with an answer. “Heavy.” She felt as though she were leaden. Her muscles incapable of moving impossibly heavy limbs.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie then moved her leg from under her. Nat watched and felt herself move in the same way. She looked down at herself, bewildered.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It’s ok Natalie, we’re trying something new.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat watched as Lottie leaned back on one arm and spread herself before Natalie. Her knees were bent and her legs were spread, so that Nat had a full view of her beautiful pussy. Nat found herself in the same position, without having given a thought to imitate it.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Good girl Natalie, you’re doing so well.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie moaned at the feeling of the praise. She felt her heat pooling low in her, and Lottie watched intently as wet spilled out of Nat.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Mmm. That’s right Natalie. It feels so good to be controlled, doesn’t it?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“It feels good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s right baby. Are you ready?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat watched as Lottie took a hand to her breast and massaged, moving slowly to her nipple and giving it a tight squeeze. Natalie felt her hand at her own breast, her own fingers squeezing her hard. She let out a gasp. The feelings of watching and being watched mixed with the disconnected feeling of being controlled. It made her feel outside herself, like she was a voyeur to her own pleasure.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Then Lottie began to move her hand lower, tracing a gentle path down her stomach.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“You’re so beautiful Natalie.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Thank you Lottie”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“I want to see how good you can make yourself feel. Do you want to see me?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes, Lottie. I want to see you.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie traced her finger along her inner thighs and kept her eyes on Nat’s gathering wet. She was glistening, moisture gathering with anticipation. Goosebumps formed on her pale skin as her gentle movements mirrored Lottie’s. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat wanted to make contact, to relive the mounting anticipation, but she couldn’t. Her hand remained a small distance from her core that she couldn’t close.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Lottie, please.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Please, what baby?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Please, can I touch myself?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Very good Natalie.” Lottie reached down and felt her own arousal from giving the praise. “You’re being such a good girl.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Natalie felt the obscene wetness that had gathered. She watched as Lottie began to tease her own entrance, wetting her fingers before penetrating herself suddenly and deeply.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“</span>
    <em>
      <span>Fuck </span>
    </em>
    <span>Lottie. Thank you”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“That’s good baby, so good.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They watched each other, eyes locked on their respective working hands, their excitement mixing in the air into a strong cocktail that made them both delirious.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Do you want to come, Natalie?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Yes Lottie, I want to come.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie moved her attention to her clit, now a hardened nub, sensitive and needy. “Are you close, baby?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt the her hand on her clit, rubbing in the most delicious way. She felt her climax building with Lottie’s question. “Yes Lottie, </span>
    <em>
      <span>so close</span>
    </em>
    <span>.”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Nat felt the words in more than one sense. She felt them being pulled closer to one another, being pulled closer to a peak they were both rising to together. The feeling stretched on forever, her orgasm mixing with Lottie’s as they came together.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>They panted as they came down together. Nat looked to Lottie disoriented, as she tried to piece together what she had experienced. “That was… what did you do?”</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Lottie bore into her again. Natalie moaned at the sensation of being pulled as her mind recovered from her climax.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>“Natalie, we’re going to bed now.”</span>
  </p>
