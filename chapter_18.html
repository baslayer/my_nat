<body>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat woke up sore.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Not just physically but also mentally. The sting across her ass, sharp and tender, mixed with the emotional burden of having enjoyed the punishment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She didn't move at first. She just laid there, held by Lottie, curled tight. The world outside was quiet again in a post-storm calm. Her body hummed with the pain and her mind buzzed along.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She thought about how she had liked it. All of it. The belt. The rules. Lottie's reprimands. The praise. The way she was told to hold still, so she did. She had loved it and that scared her. She tightened her jaw. She thought of the sharp crack of leather on skin and her own the tears of devotion streaming into the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then she thought of her dad. She thought of how she had known pain to be separate from love. He'd never loved her, she never loved him, and the beatings were regular. They hadn't been ritual or reward... only rage. Drunken anger… unpredictable and unannounced. She remembered flinching at footsteps, hiding bruises, her mom's yelling and how he'd beat her too for intervening.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She thought of the gun. The way she'd tried to put an end to it all, and then the way the universe had done it for her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;And yet, here she was. Letting herself be hit, and then thanking Lottie for it. &lt;em&gt; I'm fucking disgusting. &lt;/em&gt; She started to wonder if it was something about her, deep in her, that drove people to want to hurt her. She felt deeply that Lottie loved her, that she wanted what was best for her. &lt;em&gt; Maybe I'm just that fucked up. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She felt the way Lottie held her. Protective, possessive, warm. She was strong and her embrace made Nat feel secure and safe. She couldn't remember a time her dad had held her, and the thought alone made her feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Something twisted in Natalie's chest. She felt sicker with the guilt confused by comfort. She felt apart from her body, as if it were once an ally now made enemy by betrayal. It hadn't known the difference between harm and worship and if it had she didn't want to face what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat took a deep breath, loosened herself, and slipped out of bed. She was eager to get her run in. She craved the emotional boost of the physical activity and the mental clarity that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The pain haunted her, though. It hurt and it didn't fade, and its ever presence acted as a constant ignition of her conflicting feelings. She repeated the emotional cycle of enjoying the run, feeling the pain, feeling the arousal, and then finally the shame.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she returned she found Lottie preparing their Sunday breakfast. The spread was beautifully plentiful, as it had been the previous weeks. She looked at the chair and winced.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Good morning Natalie. How was your run?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked at her and her beauty washed over her. She gave a small smile. "It was good, thank you Lottie.*&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Are you hungry?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Yes, but, um... can I go take a shower?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Sure Nat. I'll wait for you."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Nat returned she looked at the chair again. She looked at Lottie. "Um Lottie, can I uh... stand?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked up at her, her expression unreadable. “Yes, if that’s more comfortable for you.” She moved the chair from Nat’s place at the table. “Would you like something for the pain?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Yes, please."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Lottie returned, Nat took the pills gratefully and washed them down with orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Thank you Lottie."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"You're welcome. I hope you have an appetite, though, because you'll have to eat now. The pills will make you sick on an empty stomach."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Lottie. I'Il eat."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Good."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie watched her as she picked at the food. She’d seen the way she had enjoyed the spread before and she clocked her change in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you ok, Nat?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie.” She didn’t look at her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you ok with what happened last night?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie. I needed it. You were right.” Her reverence for Lottie and deference to her opinion prevented her from endeavoring to explain her nuanced feelings.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Look at me, Nat. I want you to tell me if you didn’t like it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked down at her, holding her soft gaze. “Yes Lottie, I liked it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Was it too much?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did it hurt, you know, in a bad way?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Something is wrong, though. Please tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked away. Her breath quickened. “Lottie… I…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s ok Natalie. You can tell me. I won’t be mad.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I just, um… well… it’s about my dad. He uh… used to you know… beat me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie’s breath caught and her face fell in concern. “Oh.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;A couple beats passed in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry Nat, I didn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s ok Lottie. It’s just… that’s not what’s bothering me exactly though.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie nodded in understanding. Calm, patient.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s just that, um, I liked it. Like a lot. And um… I don’t know. I don’t know.” She was shaking her head.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie sighed. Nat couldn’t look at her. She felt shame at the admission. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I hated him so much. Like more than anyone, Lot. But I love you more than I ever hated him. I just… I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie said nothing and gave her space to continue.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat had her arms on the table, leaning over her plate, face down. “It was so bad, Lot. Like he would come home and he was drunk and it was chaos and he’d just beat the living shit out of me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Natalie…” She went to hold her arm “Natalie can I touch you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She placed two hands on Nat’s hand on the table. “I am so sorry. So, so sorry. I didn’t know, and I should have asked.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Really Nat. I don’t even know why I did it. I didn’t plan it… I just. I don’t know either.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked at her. She saw her expression of deep regret contorted in confusion in apparent self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’ll never hit you again.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, Lot. That's not it. I…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Seriously Nat, if it brings him into &lt;em&gt; this &lt;/em&gt;,” She gestured between them “I don’t want to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“But Lottie… that’s the problem. I &lt;em&gt; did &lt;/em&gt; like it. It makes me sick but I… I feel like I want it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie was silent for a moment. “Natalie, I won’t”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same.” Natalie felt herself fighting to convince her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We can do other things. You don’t have to fight yourself. I want it to feel good, without any bad.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded. “Thank you Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I think we should probably pick a word. In case things get intense again.” Lottie looked away from Nat, into the distance. “I feel like I can’t be sure of myself sometimes. And after yesterday… I don’t know. I think I need it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“But Lottie, I &lt;em&gt; like &lt;/em&gt; it when you have control over me. I don’t need to…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked back into her and interrupted. “Natalie, please.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked around at the table. “Which do you like more? Pancakes or grapes?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat laughed in relief at that jarring silliness of the question. “Grapes.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok. So if I’m ever going too far, you’ll use that word, ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you Natalie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat leaned down and kissed her. “You’re welcome Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you feel better?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“A little bit, yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok then please eat. You will be sick soon if you don’t get something in your stomach besides those painkillers.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, they returned upstairs. Lottie went over to the desk and opened a window. “I still have some homework to do. I should get it done before we go to meet Van and Tai.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The air breezed in, cool and fresh. Lottie retrieved a binder from her bag and sat down to work, her back straight, her face a mask of focus.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie hesitated by the bed, unsure for a moment whether she should speak or wait to be given something to do. Lottie caught her glance and nodded toward the mattress.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You can work on your trig if you’d like. I shouldn’t be too long.” Her voice was gentle and permissive.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat again felt the relief of direction. “Thank you, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie crawled onto the bed and stretched out on her stomach, pencil in hand, her textbook before her. Her body still ached with a dull soreness, but it bothered her less. The effect of the medication and the grounding conversation soothed her body and mind, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She worked steadily. She observed her own handwriting, noting haw neat and practiced it had started to look. The way she executed steps in columns that were easy to follow pleased her. She looked back at exercises from the earlier sections and was struck by the difference. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Her eyes drifted across the room to Lottie at the desk. She was still with her head slightly bowed, her hand moving slowly across a page periodically as she read from a worksheet. Her hair was in a neat braid, keeping her hair from obstructing her vision. The soft morning light hit her profile and she looked beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie watched her in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She felt the weight of what she’d shared with her and felt over again the comfort in how she’d handled her. Cradled her. Lottie hadn’t flinched. She’d listened to her, made her feel better when she had felt impossibly conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; I love you more than I ever hated him. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Now, watching her working calmly and confidently knowing exactly what they had discussed, what they had worked through, the statement felt even more true.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She turned her head and rested her cheek against crossed arms on the bedspread for a moment, letting the ache in her chest settle. Then, almost without thinking, she rose and moved across the room.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She knelt beside the desk chair, quiet and purposeful, and placed her hands on her thighs. She held her back straight and looked up at Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie took a moment to finish what she was writing, then she just looked down at her, bemused.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Finished already?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, Lottie. I just… wanted to be here with you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Is that so?” Lottie reached out and brushed a hand gently over her hair, her fingers sliding slowly across her scalp before settling in a slow petting motion. “Good girl.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt the warm pleasure of the praise and smiled. “Thank you Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Kneeling by her made her feel special, safe. She didn’t dwell on it and instead let herself sit in the distinct feeling of being where she belonged.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie continued petting her lazily, eyes still on her work, until she turned the page and glanced at her watch.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Woukd you like to go for a walk, Natalie?” She turned her attention to the girl kneeling before her. “The weather is nice and we could walk to the movies instead of drive.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked up at her, eyes wide, eager. “Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Very good. I’ll go get your leash.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie felt herself react in an unexpected way. She nodded and then almost leaned forward to start crawling behind the tall girl.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie laughed at her nod. “I’m joking, Natalie. You don’t have a leash yet.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded. The light confidence in Lottie’s voice reoriented her, as the familiar feelings of obedience returned free from the internal conflict and shame of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They left just after three. Nat felt the warmth of the sun on her skin and the fresh air filled her lungs. The sidewalks were wet in spots, and Lottie guided her gently around the puddles without speaking by placing  a hand at the small of her back, a light tap to her wrist. Natalie stayed close to her, half a step behind.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She felt good, natural. In her place.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They were quiet for the first block. Natalie focused on the rhythm of Lottie’s footsteps beside her. She appreciated the way she occasionally turned her head as if to check that she was still there.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They reached the corner and waited at the light. Natalie shifted her weight from foot to foot, then looked up to Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What movie are we going to see again?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Party Girl” Lottie kept her eyes on the crosswalk signal. “It’s about a girl who’s kind of… lost. She gets arrested and ends up working in a library to pay her fines. Supposed to be good. Parker Posey plays the main character.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded. “Got it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When the signal changed, Lottie took Nat’s hand as she began along the crosswalk. On the other side, they passed a shop window and Nat caught her own reflection. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She saw herself walking beside Lottie, chin tucked, hair still in a neat braid. She looked like a different version of herself, someone she almost didn’t recognize. She liked what she saw, though. The Natalie in the reflection was neat, composed, subdued. Lottie beside her looked similar, but taller. More confident. Nat held tighter onto her hand.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie slowed as they reached the park. “Want to cut through here? It’s quieter.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Whatever you want.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie stopped and looked at her, and addressed her authoritatively. “That’s not an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked up at her.  “Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie’s expression softened and she smiled. “Ok, let’s go.” They walked like that for a while. They strolled unhurried, slowly approaching their destination but walking as if they had none. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;At one point, Lottie turned to her, playfully serious. “If I did have a leash for you, you know, I’d make you walk beside me. Not behind.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie flushed and her heart raced. “Really?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course.” She glanced at her. “I’d want everyone to see how pretty and well-behaved you are.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie let out a breathless laugh. She pictured it and felt herself get warmer. &lt;em&gt; Hot. &lt;/em&gt;Lottie kissed the top of her head.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They reached the theater just past four o’clock. Van and Tai weren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie went to the booth and bought four tickets and put them in her bag, retrieving the cigarettes in the same motion. She guided Natalie to a bench and lit her cigarette and passed it before lighting her own. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked at Natalie directly and lowered her voice. “When we’re with them, you don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Make sure you don’t speak out of turn. If I need something, I’ll tell you. Understand?” Her tone was soft and clear.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good girl.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She kissed her on the forehead and then leaned back, relaxed, as they had their smoke and waited.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Van and Tai arrived, Van greeted them boisterously. “Good afternoon, ladies! Are you ready to bear witness to cinematic greatness?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Hi Van, hey Tai.” Lottie greeted them as she rose. Nat stood after her and gave a small smile and wave.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai waved warmly but Van kept her eyes on Nat "You good?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded. "Yeah."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie produced the tickets from her bag and handed two to Tai.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai nodded and smiled. "Thanks, Lot."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Of course." Lottie was smooth. "Are you guys going to get anything at the concession?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie followed Lottie as the group waited in line and got their snacks. She kept her eyes cast downand waited patiently as the others joked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Do you want anything Natalie?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"No thank you."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In the theater, she sat on the edge of the group, her hand in Lottie's, her head resting on her shoulder. She enjoyed the movie more than she expected to. Parker Posey &lt;em&gt; was &lt;/em&gt; great, and the movie was fast-paced, colorful, and light. She saw herself in Mary, and laughed periodically at her as she watched her fall deeper into her obsession with organization systems. She recognized the appreciation for orderliness, and laughed hardest when Mary admonished someone for reshelving books.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; I mean, why are we wasting our time with the Dewey Decimal System when your system is so much easier? Much easier! We'll just put the books anywhere! Hear that, everybody? Our friend here has given us a great idea! We'll just put the books any damn place we choose! &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;We don't care, right? Isn't that right? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The parallels to her own transformation were not subtle and she found it funny how Van had chosen &lt;em&gt; this &lt;/em&gt; movie for them to go see. As the credits rolled and the lights were raised, they sat and agreed Van had made a good choice for them.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie turned to the others, Nat still on her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Do you guys want to grab dinner at the diner?" Everyone agreed, and Natalie followed them out, letting Lottie guide her out of the theater by the hand.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;At the diner, they took a booth. Lottie slid in beside Natalie pinning her to the inside. Van sat acorss from Nat, with Tai across from Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The conversation split naturally - Tai pulling Lottie into some story about their anatomy lab - while&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van leaned in to talk to Nat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"So..." Van reached across the table and poked her. "How's the weekend been?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie hesitated. She glanced at Lottie - still listening to Tai - then back to Van. "Good."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"That's all I get? Good?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie tried to laugh. "We've mostly been studying. I helped her prepare for her Calc test yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Damn Scatorccio! AP Calculus now? What's next? Quantum physics?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;A waitress greeted them and dropped menus. When Nat didn't touch hers, Lottie gently nudged it toward her. "You should eat something." she said quietly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She looked at her. "Yes Lottie". And obediently opened the menu and began reading.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van clocked it. The softness in her voice, the hesitation, the deference. "You okay, Nat? You seem kinda... I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Spaced out."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie blinked and glanced at Lottie again and back to Van. "Just tired."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Stop that. It's weird."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Stop looking at Lot before you answer me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Oh, um... ok."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van gave her a long look before opening her own menu. "Is she going to cut your food up for you, too? That'd be a little too hard to watch."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie didn't laugh and instead stifled the urge to return with a smart remark. &lt;em&gt; Be Good. &lt;/em&gt; She kept silent.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van's eyes narrowed at the lack of a comeback. She started again. "So what've you guys been up to this weekend? Did you do anything fun?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai joined in and elbowed her. "Doubt it. That storm yesterday was nasty, and we have that calc test Tuesday. If I know Lottie she was studying all day."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie answered her. "Pretty much. Nat was a big help, too."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat perked up and smiled at her. She added facing Lottie as she addressed the others. "Yeah, she's going to do great."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Wow Nat, I didn't know you were so good at math. Aren't you in trig with Van?" She looked at Tai then back to Lottie. "Yeah well, um, maybe I just like math now."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van recognized her phrasing. "You got a script, Nat?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Huh?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You said the same thing to me last week.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van looked at Tai and gestured, exasperated. Tai shook her head at her, as if to say &lt;em&gt; not now &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The waitress returned to the table “What’ll ya have?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie ordered for both her and Natalie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do anything else, Nat? Don’t tell me you were studying morning to night.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat hesitated, all attention on her. “Uh… Kevyn came over last night.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van raised her brows. “Kevyn?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai looked up from her drink. “Kevyn Kevyn? Why?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“He found Lottie’s number,” Natalie said, her voice tightening. “Called and… came for dinner.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh damn,” Van said. “How’d that go?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie swallowed. “Weird. He didn’t really get it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Get what?” Van asked, too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie blinked. “Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did he say something stupid?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, uh, Lottie handled it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;That made Van’s brows pull together. “Handled it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She just… talked to him. He left.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked toward Lottie, who met her eyes and smiled calmly. She reached out and touched Natalie’s hand beneath the table.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You did well,” she murmured.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat’s cheeks pinked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van tried to pretend she wasn’t watching every second of that. She cleared her throat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie started in on them. “So what have you guys been up to?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai answered first, “Well my parents and I went into the city to visit Columbia for an admissions interview.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh wow, that’s awesome Tai, how’d it go?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Really good. I think I have a shot. I just need to get this admissions essay in and I think I could get early admission.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah she’s going to be president one day.” Van nudged her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did you go with them Van?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no. &lt;em&gt; I &lt;/em&gt; have my own life.” She looked at Nat. “I just hung out yesterday. I’m super into that setup from last weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat nodded. “That’s cool Van.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thanks Nat.” Van nodded and looked between them. “So uh, what movie did you guys end up watching last week?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked at her, puzzled. “What?” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Y’know, last week… when you guys were hanging listening to the system. You said you were going to watch a movie in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie perked slightly. &lt;em&gt; Right. Sunday movie. &lt;/em&gt; “Yeah. Last week we watched… um…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Her face went blank. The moment stretched.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her and finished her sentence. “&lt;em&gt; Heavenly Creatures &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van tilted her head. “That’s an interesting choice. Don’t they like, kill one of their moms in that one?” She saw Nat go rigid.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at Nat. “Yeah, we didn’t finish it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The food arrived. They ate. Natalie barely picked at hers. Lottie occasionally reminded her to take a bite. Van watched it all. She didn’t know what made her more uncomfortable: The way Nat looked like she was waiting for instructions, or the way Lottie gave them so quietly, so lovingly, that Nat seemed to believe it was love.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After dinner, Lottie paid the check and led them out of the diner. “We’ll walk from here, it’s so nice out.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded silently, taking her place at Lottie’s side.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai gave them a lazy salute. “See you at school.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Bye guys.” Nat gave a tired wave.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van watched her go, her smile polite, her brows pinched slightly together. Lottie gave a warm, smooth “Goodnight guys”.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The pair turned down the block and disappeared. Van stood still for a second, watching.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai looked at her “Okay. What were you constantly nudging me about?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van blinked. “Are you kidding? I feel like we just saw a creep ass movie. Tell me you saw what I saw.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Saw what?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van turned. “Natalie. It’s like her mouth was stitched closed. She didn’t say anything without looking at Lottie first. And when she did talk, it was like… I don’t know. It was empty.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai shrugged. “She’s always been kind of weird.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Not like that. This was… different. She’s a &lt;em&gt; smart ass &lt;/em&gt;, Tai. She’s always got some bullshit to say. But just now… it was like she was scared to say the wrong thing.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She said she was happy.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, like a lobotomized person says they’re happy.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai frowned. “So you think what? Lottie took an icepick to her prefrontal lobe? Then how’s she doing all that math all of a sudden?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van looked back down the block. “I think something’s going on. And I don’t think Natalie knows how deep she’s in.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai exhaled. “It’s Lottie. When is something &lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt; going on?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t woo-woo shit like she talks about with Laura Lee.” Van said. “It’s worse.. She’s in her head. I don’t know. It’s like she’s got Nat under some kind of hex or spell or something.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai gave her a look. “I think you’ve watched one too many movies..”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m serious.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You always get this way when it’s Nat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van crossed her arms. “I’m allowed to care about my friend. You said that too when I said she was in a bad way over the summer.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m not saying you can’t care. I’m saying don’t go full rescue mission unless you’re sure she &lt;em&gt; wants &lt;/em&gt; to be rescued.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van chewed on that. “I just don’t want her to disappear again.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai softened a little. “I get it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They started walking back toward the car.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van added, low. “Lottie’s dangerous when people think she’s harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tai didn’t argue.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was relieved to be back in the sanctuary of the Matthews estate. When she entered the door, she took a deep breath and took in the now familiar space. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her. “Happy to be home?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat smiled. “Yeah, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Smoke?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes, please.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat followed Lottie to the back and sat and waited for her lit cigarette. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They sat and Nat relaxed into the one-on-one dynamic she was most comfortable in.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie watched her with affectionate eyes. “You did well today, at dinner.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded, staring at the glow at the tip of her cigarette. “Thank you, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They sat like that for a while, quiet. Natalie pulled hungrily on the smoke. “Can I ask you something?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked up. “Of course.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie didn’t meet her eyes. “What happened last Sunday?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie tilted her head. “What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“The movie. You told Van we watched &lt;em&gt; Heavenly Creatures. &lt;/em&gt; I remember breakfast. I remember sitting on the couch. I saw the VHS sleeve on the table. But, uh, I don’t think we watched it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie said nothing at first. She studied her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie rushed to fill the silence. “Van asked about it. I couldn’t remember. And when I tried to remember, it just kind of felt… lost.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie’s voice was quiet. “You were upset.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie blinked. “I was?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We were watching the movie and you started breathing really heavily and when the girls started planning the murder… I stopped the movie. But you couldn’t calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie swallowed. “I don’t remember that.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I know,” Lottie said, calm. “You asked me for help.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked up sharply.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You were shaking a lot. I thought maybe you were having a panic attack. Then you looked at me and asked me to &lt;em&gt; do the thing &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I… did?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You were crying,” Lottie said, her tone soft but clinical. “So I helped you. I brought you down. I took the memory and held it for you. That’s why it’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie’s throat tightened. “You &lt;em&gt; took &lt;/em&gt; it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I protected you.” Lottie corrected her. “It was too much. You asked me to help you so I did.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie sat with that. The words felt slippery in her mind, impossible to hold.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did we finish the movie?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What did we do after?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“We went to the library. I wanted to take your mind off of it. I wanted to make you feel better.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie blinked. That part she remembered. She sat for a moment, considering Lottie’s version of events and weighed it against what she had in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did you ask me, before you did it?” Her voice lacked conviction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie leaned forward. “You asked me to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I asked you to take my memory?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie was silent a moment before speaking again. “I told you.  You asked me to &lt;em&gt; do the thing &lt;/em&gt;. I guess you know what that means.” She looked at her pointedly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat glanced at her and saw the depth in her eyes and knew. The good feeling. &lt;em&gt; I asked for the feeling.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you want the memory back?” Lottie asked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie hesitated. “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie nodded. “That’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Another beat passed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you trust me?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie finally looked at her. “Yes Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie smiled faintly. “Then let me carry that part for you. Until you’re ready.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie exhaled. “Okay.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stood slowly and walked over, sinking to her knees at Lottie’s feet. “Thank you Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie touched her hair, gently smoothing it back. “Good girl.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
