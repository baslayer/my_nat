<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie found herself on the divan. The room felt familiar but she couldn’t tell where she was. It was completely dark and music was playing in the distance. The room felt endless in both time and space. She felt as though she had always been there, that it extended without walls into infinity. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;She looked at her wrists and ankles and found them chained to the furniture’s frame. Then she saw Lottie walking towards her, out of the shadows. “Hello Natalie, how do you feel?" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie tried to answer but found she couldn’t speak.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;"It feels good, doesn't it?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt a rush of pleasure sweep over her when Lottie’s words landed in her head. She looked at Lottie, silently begging for her to do it again.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;But Lottie only stood over her, inspecting her restraints. Natalie watched as she pulled on something, then felt the shackles get tighter on her limbs. She felt it hurt and pulled against the tightening,&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;"Uh-uh-uh. Don't fight it."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat relented. She felt the pleasure of Lottie’s voice again. She moaned.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;"That's my good girl. I know you like being good for me." Lottie leaned down to kiss her forehead and stroked her hair.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Then Natalie realized the divan had become the desk, and a blank sheet of paper sat in front of her. She stared at it. She looked at her wrists and found them still shackled. She felt the conflict of the task in front of her and her inability to do it weighing on her shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt Lottie behind her, felt her place her hands on her heavy shoulders, impossibly making them feel lighter. “Do you need my help Natalie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie tried to answer, but found she was still unable to speak. She nodded.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Then she felt Lottie kissing her neck in the perfect way she does, in the way Natalie liked most.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;When she stopped, Nat felt a new heaviness around her neck. After a moment, she heard a sharp *click*, followed by a pull from behind that forced her to sit up straight.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;"Sit."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie felt choked but words still slipped past her lips. “Thank you, Lottie.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When Natalie woke up she found that she was alone in the room, though she still felt Lottie's presence. She took a deep breath and brought her hand to her neck, the memory of her dream still fresh. Her waking mind was hazy and dulled but she was aware of the low ache in her abdomen. "Fuck", she whispered to herself.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She got up and went into the bathroom to refresh herself. Splashing her face with cold water, she looked at herself in the mirror. She heard a question in Lottie's voice as she stared, "are you a good girl, Natalie?" She throbbed and reached down to splash more water into her face. The feeling remained so she turned and got into the shower, instead. She turned on the cold water and felt the sharp rush of clarity as it hit her hot skin.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She changed into her running clothes and went downstairs. When she heard Lottie's voice, she almost flinched. "Good Morning Natalie. Going for a run?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie was at the dining table, helping the staff set up another Sunday breakfast.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Yeah, uh, is that ok? Do you want me to stay?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"You may go. Breakfast will be ready for you when you get back."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Ok. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;On her run, the memory of her dream faded as the clarity generated by the exercise took its place. She began to think about the day ahead of her to be spent with Lottie. It made her run faster, as though she could bring it closer with increased effort.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie returned from her run and took another quick shower before joining Lottie in the dining room. "Thank you for breakfast, Lot." She felt hungry and grateful for the spread.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"You're welcome, Natalie. Bon Appetit."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They ate for a few minutes in silence. The memory of the dream had completely faded with the help of the showers and run, but Natalie found herself in an obedient mood as the impression of it lingered.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When Lottie spoke, Nat stopped eating and gave her her full attention. “So you said you wanted to watch another movie today?” Her voice was light and her eyes were soft, but Nat felt them heavily all the same.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Yes, Lottie. Is that ok?" Natalie looked at her directly.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie held her gaze and gave her a half smile. "Of course, Natalie. Why wouldn't it be?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Oh... um, I don't know." She looked away, and then thought of the desk. "I still have to write my essay again." &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie nodded and returned to her food. "That's true, but I think you've earned a break. I don't think Mr. O'Neill expects you to hand it in again on Monday. He just returned it to you on Friday.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat nodded in compliance. "Ok."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie looked at her curiously. "Are you finished eating?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt Lottie’s eyes on her but kept her gaze on her half finished food. Instead of responding to the persistent hunger in her belly, she searched for an answer that Lottie would want to hear. “Yeah I’m done.” She looked back to Lottie for approval.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Is something wrong, Natalie? You've hardly eaten."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"No, I just... I…” She searched for a reason to give her.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Why don't you finish your plate?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie relaxed at the direction. “Ok." She started eating again.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Once they were in the TV room, Nat's mind went directly to the memory of the last time they were there together. She looked at Lottie, who seemed incredibly at ease, and imagined kissing her on the couch again.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"So Nat, are you still in the mood for 'New and Weird'?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She went to the sofa and sat on the middle cushion. "Sure." Nat leaned back and relaxed as the coziness of the room comforted her.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Well… I have this movie I've been wanting to watch... It's supposed to be really good." She looked at Nat mischievously. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat raised her eyebrows at the look Lottie was giving her. "Uh, what's it about?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie unwrapped the cellophane and handed over the tape. She turned and began to prepare the TV. "It's the true story of these girls in New Zealand who killed one of their moms because they were like, together, I guess. I'm not totally sure. We don't have to watch if you don't want to. We have a lot of other movies.*&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;As Natalie pretended to read the case, she mentally panicked and thought of her dad. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Does she know?&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; “What did Van say to you last night?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie paused, surprised by the question. "What, Natalie?" She turned to look at her.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Last night, when we were leaving Van's... she asked if she could talk to you. I went to the car... what did you guys talk about?" Nat felt anxiety building in her as she questioned Lottie. She hadn't planned on asking her about the conversation, but an intense paranoia that Van had shared something sensitive crashed over her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Fuck. She fucking knows.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"She just thanked me for taking care of you, Nat. That's it."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Are you sure?" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Yeah, what's wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie shook her head. "Nothing."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Ok… so do you want to watch this or something else?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She gave a small smile. "Whatever you want, Lot."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie slid the tape into the deck and took her seat next to Nat. She put her arm out, inviting Nat to sit with her. As the smaller girl curled into a complementary shape, Lottie raised the remote and cued to the beginning of the film.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The story drew Nat in quickly, and she watched with undivided attention despite Lottie’s nearness. She felt the intensity of the girls’ connection, the foreboding of the looming murder. Her nerves were strained but she was captivated. She didn’t realize it but she was breathing heavily. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;As the climactic murder loomed, Natalie started to feel sick to her stomach. She felt hot and nervous as the suspense built towards the inevitable attack. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie paused the tape. “Nat, are you ok?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She hesitated, struck by the tenderness in Lottie’s voice. “No… I uh… I feel sick.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Do you want to stop watching?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I don’t want to see it happen.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie turned the screen off and pulled Nat in tighter. She kissed the top of her head and waited to feel her relax.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Minutes passed but Nat’s distress didn’t fade. She couldn’t stop the scene from repeating in her head. The gun. The trigger. The click. The taunting. The accident.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie felt the small girl in her arms shaking. “It’s ok. It’s ok… shhh” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie couldn’t bring herself out of the mental prison of the traumatic memory. The events just kept reverberating around in her head, grating on her, both driving the pain of it all deep into her and boiling it to the surface. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Natalie, can you tell me what’s wrong?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“No.” It came out of her, barely audible.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Ok, don’t worry.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat turned to look at Lottie. She searched her eyes for the soothing place they took her to. “&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;” She felt herself sinking slowly, but it wasn’t enough. “Do the &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie understood what she meant and looked into her with intention. “You’re ok, Natalie.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Before she could register the change in intensity, Natalie was deep down, her conscienceness distant. Her body relaxed as the pain left her eyes, which stayed transfixed on Lottie’s. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“I’m ok.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie held her there.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“It feels good, right Natalie?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“It feels good.” &lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Do you remember what was bothering you?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie couldn’t answer her.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“I want you to forget about the movie.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“Forget about the movie.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“We didn’t watch anything.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“We didn’t watch anything.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“We just sat together, ok?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“We sat together.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie brought Nat’s head back towards her and held her there.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat came to herself in a daze. She felt the warmth of Lottie's embrace and the empty feeling of missing time. She looked at the TV and saw it was off. The room was dark and she heard nothing besides soft, even breathing in her ear. Lottie kissed her head. "Are you ok, Natalie?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The question echoed in her. She felt empty, absent. "I, uh, I don't..." The search for words to respond to the question came up empty. Instead she pushed herself further into Lottie. She felt the couch was an island, or an unmoored ship, and a sea of nothingness surrounded the two of them. She closed her eyes and breathed, trying to ground herself.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They sat like that for a while, until Lottie had an idea. "Hey Nat, how are you feeling?" &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat loosened from her fetal position. "Ok"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Do you want to do something fun?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt no connection to the word. "What do you mean, Lot?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"I have an idea but it's kind of, big. I think you will really like it, though."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"What is it?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Can I surprise you? Will you trust me?"&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat turned to look up at Lottie. "Of course."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;"Ok. Wait here."&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;As Lottie left the room she raised the lights. Nat looked around, somewhat confused. The room had no windows, so there was no indication of the time, but she felt as though she were missing a big chunk of it. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;How long were we sitting here?&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She thought back to breakfast and tried to chain events together but failed. There was nothing between eating and the moment she had found herself in. She couldn't picture sitting down, only that she had found herself sat. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She looked to the TV stand and saw the VCR was on, but she didn't remember choosing a movie. She stood and found the empty sleeve for the VHS.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Heavenly Creatures.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She felt a pang of stress deep in herself and immediately put the sleeve down, unsettled by the visceral response. She sat herself back on the couch and put her face in her hands. She felt the stickiness of dried tears.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When Lottie returned, she was emanating excitement and warmth. “Ok the car’s ready. Are you ready to go?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie looked down at herself. “I guess so.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Outside, a Rolls Royce was idling in the drive. When she and Lottie approached, a driver emerged and opened the rear door in front of them. Lottie smiled at her and gestured forward. “After you.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat looked at the luxury vehicle, somewhat bewildered. Lottie drove a Mercedes E-class, and it was really nice, but this was like a mansion on wheels. She stepped forward slowly and sat down.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Please scoot in a little bit, Nat” She moved, and Lottie entered after her. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The door shut behind them and the driver took his place. “Are you ready to go, Miss Matthews?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yes, thank you.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Then the car was moving with an unreal smoothness, as if it were rolling across clouds instead of asphalt. Nat watched through tinted windows as Wiskayok passed by and they got onto the parkway. “Are we going into the city?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat felt anticipation building in her. She hadn’t been to the city since she was a little girl. Her memories of it were faded, but they were tinged with excitement. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When they emerged from Lincoln Tunnel to the grand expanse of Manhattan. Lottie watched with a wide smile as Nat bent her head to peer out the window at the tall buildings that surrounded them. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Soon, they came to a stop and the driver opened the door for them to exit. Nat stepped out onto the sidewalk and saw a grand, romanesque extended along fifth avenue before her. “&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Wow&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie said something to the driver that Nat couldn’t hear, and then she was holding her hand. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat looked down at their hands and then up again to the building. It stood with monumental grandeur, its facade adorned with corinthian columns, a broad staircase, and broad terraces. Nat felt boldly small as she stood before it. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Across the entablature, in stately capital letters, Nat read &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;The New York Public Library.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Are we going inside?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“No, Nat, we came all this way to spend time with Patience and Fortitude.” She gestured her head from side to side.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat was the picture of confusion. “Who?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Nevermind. Yes, we’re going inside.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat held onto Lottie’s hand as she led the way up the worn marble stairs to the tall, bronze doors. She could hear the humming of the city quieted as the door shut behind her. She looked up at the frescoed, arched ceilings and inhaled the rich fragrance of polish, paper, and the faint tang of time. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie leaned and whispered into her ear. “I was thinking we could do some reading.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat looked at her wide-eyed and curious. “What kind of books do they have here?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie laughed. “Probably any kind of book you could think of. Come on.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie led her to the catalog room, where tall wooden cabinets held drawers of index cards. “What kind of books do you want to read?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie was still reeling. “I have no fucking idea.” The expletive came out of her as a genuine expression of intensity.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She followed Lottie as she took an index card and pencil from an endcap and methodically looked up a series of books, noting each of the catalog numbers. From there they went to the main reading room to the reference desk. Nat watched as she confidently completed the request slip and passed it to the staff member, who then sent the slip through a pneumatic tube.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie looked at her. “Now we wait.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They took a pair of seats at the long oak tables in front of a green-shaded lamp. Nat was still looking around in awe. The soft sounds of the library played like music. Small sounds- a turning page, the graphite of a pencil- echoed delicately off the limestone walls. “It’s so… pretty.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie was only looking at Nat. “You’re pretty.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat looked at her. “Am I dreaming?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“No.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Are you sure?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat craned her neck and looked into the murals of vibrant clouds on the ceilings. She thought for a moment that she was looking through skylights directly into the heavens, and reached for Lottie’s hand and held it tight, as though she thought she may start floating through them.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The staff member called from the desk. “Charlotte Matthews”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie leaned over. “I need you to let me go. I’ll be right back.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat nodded and released her grasp then watched as she strode to the desk and collected their books. When she returned she presented three books to Nat: &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;The Elements of Euclid&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; by Oliver Byrne, a book on the &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;De Stijl &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;art movement, and a book about the building itself, &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;The New York Public Library: The Architecture and Decoration of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She saw Lottie had her own stack of books, too, covering the topics of literature and music. “Ok Natalie” She looked at her watch. “We need to meet the driver out front in 3 hours. If you want to leave before that, we can go to Bryant Park or walk along Fifth Avenue. Just let me know what you want to do.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She nodded her head. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie never asked to leave. She read fiendishly, as if she were starved and presented with an epic feast of knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;First she looked through the book about the building. She read about the facade and about the frescos above her head. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Then she went to the &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;De Stijl&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; book, and read about Mondrian and van Doesburg and the pursuit of abstracted, pure idealism.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When she moved on to &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Euclid&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;, she recognized immediately the red, blue, and yellow illustrations as expressions of &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;de stijl&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;. She saw the postulates presented in steps, and felt the compulsion to follow along, as if it were an exercise from her textbook.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Hey Lot, is there pen and paper around?” Lottie pointed to a stacks of loose sheets and trays of pencils.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When she returned, she got to work in earnest, executing the steps as they were described and marveling at the simple beauty of the resultant shapes and truths.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Time went by quickly, and soon Lottie was telling her they had to bring the books back to the desk.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She held the &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Euclid&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; book to the table as Lottie went to take it. “But I thought you could borrow books from the library?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Not this one. They keep all the books underground. The good news is, it will always be here and you can come back and read it again.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Nat nodded. She closed the book and wrote the title on her paper, which she then folded and put into her pocket. She stood and collected the books with Lottie and followed her to return them to the desk.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The entire ride home her mind swam with shapes in red, blue, and yellow. Bold lines bisected squares, circles, and triangles. She thought of math and art and the way they came together to make things that were so pure and &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;good&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She thought of how almost a week ago Lottie had shown her the unit circle she’d drawn, then how she’d drawn her own so feverishly, in pursuit of perfection. She thought of the textbook Lottie had given her, then how Lottie had chosen those books for her today, and it made her feel profoundly understood.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She looked at Lottie as she reflected. Then she looked at the driver. “How long until we get back home?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie smiled at her, immediately clocking the implication of the question. “Shouldn’t be too long.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;When they walked inside Natalie immediately reached up and met lottie lips not in hunger, but in worship. She imagined herself and Lottie as two flawless shapes, meeting in perfection to create profound beauty. She felt Lottie bring her hands to the back of her head to pull her up into her, deepening their connection, making it more certain. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie slid her hand under Lottie’s shirt and felt the perfect curve of her spine. Her mind swam with visions of the beauty of the library’s architecture, and imagined the tall girl as divine as the perfectly sculpted forms. The layered feeling of connection she felt to Lottie fluttered in her, like delicate pages of the books.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Soon she felt Lottie moving her toward the divan and guiding her to sit, without breaking their kiss. Nat gasped as she felt Lottie’s hand reach beneath her shirt, her fingertips trailing over her ribs before gently grasping her breast. “&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“Can we take this off?” She was holding the hem of her shit.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie nodded and took off her top and undid her bra, then re-engaged in worshipping Lottie with her mouth. She moaned as she felt her hold her bare breast, then graze her thumb over her nipple, making it harden under her soft fingertip. Lottie broke the kiss and took the nipple in her mouth, circling and teasing it with her tongue. Natalie clutched her head to her chest and started to babble as the sensation sent her head into a tailspin. “&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Thank you Lottie, Oh my god you’re so fucking perfect”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;She reached down Lottie’s back and grabbed at her shirt to pull it off of her. Lottie chuckled then stood up and fully undressed. She disrobed quickly but gracefully, her eyes not meeting Nat’s but instead remaining focused on her flawless body. When she finished with her own clothes she returned to Nat and began to remove her jeans. Natalie felt the pooling wetness as she watched her. She resisted the urge to reach down to feel her own arousal and instead clutched a breast in each hand.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They came together again fully stripped of anything besides their corporal selves, all passion and no restraint. Lottie slotted her leg between Nat’s as she leaned over her and went in on her neck. She used her thigh to press into the heat coming from Nat’s core. The heat and wet on her leg made her feel like fire, and she bit down out of the intensity of the feeling. Nat felt the pressure on her and the bite all at once and it hit her like a tidal wave, drowning her in overwhelming pleasure and pain. A guttural moan from deep in her escaped Nat’s lips as her hips bucked for more friction.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“That’s right baby, so good.”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Lottie hadn’t intended to engage in the dominant dirty talk, but the way Nat moved under her elicited a powerful urge she was in no position to resist. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The words similarly made Nat feel wild, and she joined in. “Please Lottie. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;I’m so good for you&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;.” &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;Fuck&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt; Natalie.” Lottie leaned back and shifted her hips lower. She took one of Nat’s legs and brought it up to her shoulders, then rotated so her their heats met. Lottie began to thrust rhythmically against the small girl, rolling her hips so the contact was perfect. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;The obscene sounds of meeting wetness mixed with their moans as Lottie worked them both up. Lottie loved the feeling of being on top, loved the view of the small girl from above. “Is that what you like, Natalie? You like when I fuck you like this?”&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;Natalie could only muster a half-sob half moan, as she tried to press reciprocal thrusts in time with Lottie’s rhythm. &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;On impulse, the tall girl reached down and grabbed both of the blonde girl’s peaked nipples, and twisted hard. Natalie screamed as the pain drove her to ecstasy. The sounds coming from her were constant and unbroken as her orgasm erupted from the sensation.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;“That’s right Natalie, that’s good. You’re so good for me, &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;span&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;” Lottie babbled as she chased her own release. When it came it crashed over her with crippling intensity. She lost her balance and fell onto Nat, and rode it out pressed against her, flinching through the aftershocks.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;span&gt;They laid there for a moment breathing heavily. Lottie had one leg on the ground, to keep her from fulling sliding off the relatively small surface. Natalie held Lottie’s head under her own and stroked her hair. When Lottie regained her strength, she motioned to stand, but Nat held her in place. Lottie relaxed onto her again and waited until she was ready to let go.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
