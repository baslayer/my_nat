Nat's eyes opened slowly to find Lottie not next to her. She looked around and found her sat at the edge of the bed, hair already braided, eyes turned toward the window. Her posture was relaxed but there was something off in it. Too still, too quiet. Natalie pushed up onto her elbows, watching her for a moment before she spoke.

“Lottie?” Her voice came out low, sleep-softened.

Lottie turned her head, her expression smooth as always but a little muted at the edges. “Good morning, baby.”

Natalie pushed herself up fully now, sitting back against the pillows. “You’re up early.”

Lottie’s mouth lifted faintly in a smile, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I couldn’t sleep.”

Nat's heart gained pace at the admission. “Are you okay?” She was careful.

“I’m fine.” Lottie said, her voice smooth and practiced. But Natalie was listening close enough now to hear the undercurrent.

Nat rose and began her routine. She tied her shoes in neat double knots, then stood and crossed the room to and knelt before Lottie.

“Come with me.”

Lottie looked down at her. “Where?”

“On my run.” Natalie kept her voice steady, even as her heart thudded a little faster at asking for something unprompted. “Please come.”

For a beat, Lottie didn’t answer. Then she moved to stroke Nat's hair and gave a small smile. “Okay, baby.”

Natalie blinked slow at the comfort of her touch and agreement. "Thank you Lottie."


When they returned to the house, the scent of fresh coffee and warm bread met them as soon as they stepped inside. The dining table was already set for their Sunday brunch. Two places,  plates of fruit and pastry arranged between them, perfectly laid out.

Nat looked toward Lottie, who was standing just inside the doorway. Her posture was calm as ever, hands at her sides, but there was something too still about her again. Like she wasn’t fully settled into the space.

"Lottie?"

"Yes Natalie?"

Her voice came low and steady. "I think we should take a shower before we eat."

Lottie blinked once, her mouth lifted faintly, and she nodded. “You’re right, baby.”

Natalie felt the small pulse of relief that came with keeping things in rhythm. But underneath it, there was a second feeling now. One she was still getting used to. A quiet concern pulling at her chest, seeing Lottie off her mark.

She didn’t question it. She just stepped back to her and took Lottie’s hand lightly, to lead her upstairs. She unbuckled her watch as she walked in and set it on the dresser. 

"Do you want to go first, Lot?"

"Sure, Natalie. Thank you."

Nat watched her move smoothly, her face calm but muted. She recognized the expression as indicating a state she ws familiar and comfortable with: running on automatic. Mind blanked, trusting the power of routine to get her through.

When Lottie emerged from the bathroom, Nat rose from the desk. "Do you feel better?"

"Yes Natalie."

"Ok." Nat felt uneasy.

When they returned to the dining room, Natalie sat first and waited. She kept her eyes on Lottie as she took her seat across from her, waiting for her silent cue.

"Bon Appetit", Nat said. 

Lottie nodded and began to serve herself. Nat kept her eyes on Lottie longer than usual, watching for something she couldn’t quite name.

They ate in silence for a long stretch, the only sounds the quiet clink of silverware against porcelain. Natalie kept her gaze on her plate at first. Bite, chew, swallow. She let the rhythm calm her but she couldn’t keep her eyes from flicking up, again and again, to where Lottie sat opposite her.

There was a weight hanging in the air that routine couldn’t cut through. Finally, Natalie set her fork down gently. Her voice came and low, careful. “Lottie?”

Lottie's eyes lifted, meeting Natalie’s, calm but heavier now.

Natalie hesitated, fingers flexing lightly against her lap. “Did I… did I do something?” Her voice softened further. “Are you upset because of me?”

For a moment, Lottie didn’t answer. Her expression didn’t shift, but Natalie could feel her thinking. Then Lottie exhaled slowly through her nose and set her coffee down. Her voice was steady, but quieter than usual. “No, baby. It’s not you.”

Natalie waited, wanting to say more but not sure if she should.

Lottie glanced down, her fingers brushing once along the edge of her plate. Then she looked back up. “It’s me. I’ve just been thinking.”

“About what?” 

Lottie’s mouth lifted faintly, but it wasn’t a real smile. “About what you said yesterday. About how it feels good when I… help you.”

Natalie’s chest tightened. “It does.” She said it automatically, voice quick and certain.

Lottie’s eyes softened in a way that felt unfamiliar—less controlled. Less sure. “I know, baby. I know. But… I mean, I told you that. I made it so you like it."

She paused for long time then spoke again. "Doesn’t part of you want your life back? Doesn't it bother you that I... put that in your head?” Her voice dropped lower, like she was testing the words as she said them. “Doesn’t part of you want to... not need me like this?”

Natalie’s breath caught. For a second, she didn’t know how to answer.

Lottie kept speaking, slower now. “When I did it... when I showed you, that first time. I just wanted to help, wanted you to let me help. I didn’t want you to hurt anymore, but now…” She trailed off and looked away, just for a second. “Now I don’t know if I did the right thing.”

Silence settled again, but heavier this time.

Lottie looked back at her, voice quieter still. “I don’t want you to leave me. But maybe I should have let you figure things out yourself. Maybe I'd be happier if I had let you listen to me on your own. I wouldn't be afraid you're going to leave.”

Natalie felt each word settle in her like a stone dropping through water. She wasn’t used to Lottie sounding like this. Uncertain. Afraid.

Her own voice felt small when she spoke. “I don’t want to leave you.”

“I don’t want to leave you” She repeated herself, voice steadier. She held Lottie’s gaze. Her fingers brushed lightly against the table’s edge, grounding herself in the feel of it. “I mean it.”

Lottie didn’t speak. Her eyes bore into Natalie, looking for something.

Natalie’s breath caught in her throat for a moment at the feeling but she pushed through it. “I don’t care how you did it.” Her voice stayed quiet, but there was a kind of finality to it now. “I wouldn’t have listened but now I'm glad I did.”

Lottie’s brows pulled together slightly, but she stayed silent.

Natalie kept going, emboldened by the feeling of making a profound realization. “I was already… I wasn’t even really living before. I didn’t have a life. Not really.” She swallowed, voice catching just a little. “You gave me something to hold onto. A purpose.You gave me… peace.”

Lottie exhaled slowly, the smallest shake of her head, like she couldn’t quite believe her.

“I mean it. This is my life now. With you.” Her fingers flexed once against the table, then she pushed her chair back, standing up. Her hand reached out, resting lightly on Lottie’s shoulder. “You helped me because I needed it. And I still do.”

Lottie looked up at her then, something soft and stricken in her face. Natalie had never seen her quite like this. Like all the smooth control had been peeled back, leaving something rawer underneath.

“I’d be worse without you.” Natalie said simply. “You know that.”

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. Then Lottie lifted her hand and covered Natalie’s, pressing it down lightly against her shoulder. “Okay, baby.”

Natalie stood over her, hand still resting on Lottie’s shoulder, feeling the quiet tension in her body. She felt Lottie’s breathing slow, but not quite settle.

Natalie didn’t want to see her like this. Off-balance, uncertain. It felt wrong, like the weight of everything had shifted from Natalie onto her shoulders. She sat down again.

"Look at me." She saw the pain in big brown eyes. Her voice came softer, surer. “You shouldn’t feel bad for helping me.”

Lottie’s eyes search her.

Natalie took a breath. “I never really told you. About what happened with my dad.”

Lottie’s brows pulled together slightly, but she didn’t interrupt.

Nat turned away, her body slightly deforming in shame. “I tried to shoot him.”

The words dropped into the room heavily.

“He was yelling. He was drunk. I don’t even remember what about anymore.” Her throat felt tight, but she pushed through it. “I pointed the gun. I pulled the trigger.” Natalie’s voice caught. “But the safety was on.”

Natalie swallowed, eyes fixed on the plate in front of her. “He laughed at me. Took the gun, clicked the safety off to mock me. But then he tripped and…" She took a deep breath. "It went off on its own.” Her voice dropped lower. “It was an accident.”

A pregnant silence hung. Lottie didn't prompt her. Nat felt her heart pounding in her ears.

“I've never felt safe Lot. I didn't feel it when he was alive, I didn't feel it after he died. I don't even know if I knew what it would even feel like." Nat returned her eyes to Lottie's. "I know it now. It's the feeling that you give me." 

She tried to focus harder, like Lottie did to her sometimes, trying to force the words deeper into her. "So whatever you did… I don’t care. Don’t think of it like it’s some bad thing. It's good.”

Lottie’s face shifted, she exhaled slow through her nose and broke the eye contact. She took Nat's hand and kissed it.

“Thank you for telling me, baby.”

"Do you feel better?"

Lottie sighed deeply. "I don't know. I'm not sure."

"What can I do? I don't like seeing you this way." Nat got onto her knees and placed her head in Lottie's lap. "Tell me what to do."

Lottie looked down at here and put her hand over her mouth. Tears pooled behind her eyes. "Natalie."

"Lottie."

"You trust me too much."

Lottie’s hand moved gently over Natalie’s hair, her fingers threading through slow, deliberate. Her breath caught on a faint, uneven inhale.

“I don’t know if I can be sure.” Lottie said finally, voice low and steady, but edged with something raw now. “That’s the truth.”

Natalie stayed quiet, her head resting in Lottie’s lap, eyes closed against the warmth of her hand.

“I’ve… I’ve been sick before.” Lottie’s words felt measured, like she was pressing each one out carefully, not just for Natalie, but for herself too. “I hear things sometimes, see things. Or I used to. Before the medication.” Her voice dropped quieter still. “I was in the hospital for it.”

Natalie’s breath caught slightly. She opened her eyes, but didn’t lift her head.

“That’s why I don’t go to some private school, you know?” Lottie’s thumb brushed lightly along the edge of Natalie’s hairline. “My parents thought it’d be… too much. Too many people. Too close. So I came here.”

The words added a thick layer to the heaviness in the room.

“I’ve spent so long being told not to trust myself.” Lottie said, voice soft. “That I shouldn’t listen to what I think is right. And I can control it now. Mostly. But when I look at you...” Her hand stilled again, resting fully against Natalie’s head. “I don’t know if I’m really helping you or if it’s just what I want to believe.”

Natalie’s fingers flexed lightly against Lottie’s leg. Her voice came quiet, steady as she could make it. “You are helping me.”

Lottie gave a small, broken laugh, almost like she didn’t trust the sound coming out of her own mouth. “How can you know that, Natalie? If I really… if I did something to you, how do you know it’s real?”

Natalie pushed up slightly then, just enough to look up at her. Her voice was soft but sure. “Because I feel it. I know it in my body. I see it in my life.” Her hand came up to touch Lottie’s wrist lightly, grounding both of them. “You could’ve done it to anyone. But you did it to me. You chose me. Because I needed you.”

Lottie’s face broke then. Her control faltered completely for the first time. Her brows pulled together, tears glimmering faintly in her eyes. Her lips parted like she was going to speak, but nothing came.

“I want to stay here with you.” Natalie’s voice trembled just slightly now, but her conviction didn’t. “Even if it’s a little fucked up. Even if we’re both a little fucked up. It’s better than how it was before.”

Lottie’s breath shuddered out, and she leaned down, pulling Natalie up into her lap fully, arms wrapping around her tight.

“I love you,” Lottie whispered against her hair. Her voice cracked around it. “So much.”

Natalie pressed her face into Lottie’s shoulder, feeling the steadiness come back to her pulse. To both of them. “I love you too.”

And for the first time in what felt like hours, the quiet that settled around them wasn’t heavy. It wasn’t weighed with doubt. It was just… quiet. And still.

A long beat passed before Nat broke the silence. "Are we finished with brunch now?"

Lottie laughed lightly, genuinely. "Have you finished eating?"

"Yes Lottie"

"Ok. The yes, Natalie. We are finished with brunch now."

"I think we watch a movie next."

Lottie smiled and rose. "You're right. Let's go." And put her hand out.

Nat took it and followed her to the TV room.

“Do you want to choose today?”

Nat took her seat on the couch and shook her head once. “No, Lottie. You choose.”

Lottie considered her for a moment, then turned to the shelves of VHS tapes lining the walls. “I’m going to choose three,” Lottie said lightly as she knelt, fingers trailing along the spines. “Then you’ll choose one of them.”

Natalie nodded once, hands folded in her lap. “Yes Lottie.”

Lottie spent a moment scanning, not in a rush. Her fingers tapped absently on one case, then another, before she pulled down a first choice. Then a second. Then a third.

When she stood, she turned, tapes in hand. “Here.” Her voice was calm again, her smile faint but real. “Neighbor Totoro. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. Or The Princess Bride.”

back to the stack of tapes on the shelf. Her voice was lighter than it had been all morning. “Okay... Totoro, Ferris Bueller, or Princess Bride?”

Lottie set them down on the coffee table in a neat stack. Nat investigated them, reading the sleeves. "This one." 

Lottie nodded and smiled. "As you wish."

They sat together on the couch, illuminated by the glow of the screen. Natalie fit herself into Lottie, resting her head under Lottie’s outstretched arm. Lottie’s hand moved slowly through her hair, lazy but consistent.

They laughed softly together during the movie. Natalie felt light, like something heavy inside her had been untied and lifted away. Every so often, she tilted her head up to entice Lottie into a deep kiss. Her hand would press lightly against Lottie’s ribs as she leaned up, mouth slow and sure against hers. Lottie always kissed her back with the calm, deliberate inevitability. 

Sometimes her mind drifted away from the story. She thought about how exposed she’d let herself be. How she’d said everything and Lottie had only held her closer. 

And Lottie too—Lottie, with her quiet morning unrest, her confession about her mind. It wasn’t perfect calm, but it felt right. Like they were both too fucked up in different ways and had found the only place where that made sense. And it wasn’t just okay. It was good. It was perfect.

She'd felt like a piece fitting into a puzzle before, but now she felt a full understanding of what that meant. It wasn't just a feeling, it the truth of how she belonged to Lottie. She wasn’t just something that needed holding together. She could help hold Lottie together too.

She started to cry.

Lottie didn't ask her why. She reached down and wiped her cheek in silent understanding, then returned her arm to her shoulders and held her tighter.


The movie ended in a slow fade to black, the credits rolling in soft white text. Natalie barely noticed. Her head was still tucked under Lottie’s arm. Her hand stroked her hair once more, then stilled.

A long quiet stretched between them until Lottie spoke, her voice low, steady. “What would you like to do now, baby?”

Natalie breathed in. Her heart felt calm. She didn't feel anxiety over choice presented to her. She didn't worry about choosing right. Instead she felt the need low in her stomach  to be closer.

“I want to go upstairs.” Her tone making the implication clear.

Lottie didn’t answer right away. Her hand shifted slightly against Natalie’s shoulder. Her body tensed slightly.

“Are you sure?” Her voice held a careful note.

Natalie lifted her head from Lottie’s shoulder. She met Lottie’s eyes fully. Her voice came clear.
“Yes Lottie.”

Her pulse beat steady in her wrist as she said it. Lottie searched her face like she was reading every muscle, searching for expression of hesitation. Natalie kept still, steady under her gaze.

Lottie exhaled slowly, her hand moving to rest against Natalie’s jaw. Her thumb brushed once across her cheek.
“Okay, baby.”

Lottie leaned in and kissed her, soft and deliberate. Then she stood and held out her hand. Natalie took it without hesitation.

They crossed the room slowly, hand in hand. Neither of them spoke as they climbed the stairs. Inside the bedroom, Lottie closed the door behind them, the sound quiet and final.

For a moment, they just stood there. Facing each other in the stillness.

Natalie was the first to move. She stepped forward and dropped her gaze deliberately, lowering her eyes to Lottie’s collarbone, then lower still, until she was looking at the center of Lottie’s chest rather than her face.

Her voice was quiet, steady.
“Tell me what to do.”

Lottie didn’t answer right away. Natalie kept her posture straight, arms loose at her sides, waiting. She felt her heart beat harder. Not with the edge of anticipation, but full and present in her chest.

Then she felt Lottie’s fingers under her chin, tilting her face up. Her eyes met Lottie’s again, and this time Lottie’s expression wasn’t soft. It wasn’t unsure. It was steady. Focused. “Take off your clothes.”

Natalie obeyed, methodically. Shirt first, then bra, then shorts. By the time she turned back, Lottie’s eyes were on her fully. Appreciative. Possessive. She hadn’t undressed herself yet. Only watched.

Lottie stepped forward, hands skimming over Natalie’s ribs, her breasts, then up over her shoulders and down her back, settling on her hips. Her touch was firmer and deliberate.

“Get on the bed.”

Natalie moved without hesitation. She climbed onto the bed and knelt, facing the headboard, waiting.

She heard Lottie undressing behind her. The sound of buttons, the faint rustle of fabric falling to the floor. Her pulse quickened with every quiet sound.

Then Lottie’s hands came to her again. One palm flat against her lower back, steadying her. The other trailing up her spine.

Lottie leaned in close, voice low against Natalie’s ear. “Mine.”

Natalie exhaled slowly. “Yours.” Her whole body eased at the word.

Lottie’s hand slid around to her front, moving down her stomach, slow and purposeful. Her other hand moved to Natalie’s hair, gathering it loosely in her fist. Not pulling, just holding. The touch wasn’t gentle, but it wasn’t punishing either. It was strong. Purposeful.

Natalie closed her eyes She felt her mind empty completely as she focused on the sensations. Fingers on her skin, head held by Lottie's grip on her hair. 

Lottie’s hand moved lower, fingers slipping between Natalie’s thighs, slow but unhesitating.
“Spread for me.”

Natalie obeyed immediately, knees widening against the bed. She exhaled as Lottie’s fingers slid through her, already wet, already ready.

“That’s my girl.” Lottie murmured, voice right against her ear. Her grip on Natalie’s hair tightened just slightly. Still not pulling, but anchoring her there, holding her in place.

Natalie’s breath stuttered as Lottie’s fingers pressed in slowly. The stretch felt like a reassurance: solid, deliberate, steady. Natalie closed her eyes, focusing on that feeling. Being filled. Being held.

Her own voice came out low, instinctual. “Thank you Lottie.”

Lottie’s hand stilled for a moment, holding her there. “You’re sure?”

Natalie nodded without opening her eyes. “I’m sure. I want it. I want whatever you want.” Her voice trembled just faintly from feeling it so deeply. It was almost too much in her chest, all at once.

Lottie let out a slow breath against her neck. “Good girl.”

The praise settled in Natalie and she throbbed around Lottie's hand.

Lottie’s other hand left her hair then, sliding down to join the first. One hand worked inside her, slow and deep, while the other circled her clit deliberately. No rush. No urgency. Just control. Just care.

Natalie’s whole body arched into it, hands dropping to brace against the headboard. Her pulse beat heavy in her ears, matched by the wet sound of Lottie’s fingers moving in her.

“You feel that?” Lottie asked, her voice like velvet. “That’s mine too. All of it.”

“Yes Lottie,” Natalie gasped, voice cracking around it. “Yours.”

Lottie pressed a kiss to her shoulder, then her neck, then lower, biting lightly at her skin. Her rhythm didn’t falter once.

And then Lottie shifted behind her, nudging Natalie’s knees wider still, opening her completely. Her voice stayed steady, coaxing and absolute.
“Keep still for me. Don’t come until I tell you.”

Natalie whimpered but nodded, gripping the headboard tighter to steady herself. Her whole body was one long, trembling line of held tension.

After a minute, Lottie slid her fingers out and moved around her. Natalie opened her eyes, half-dazed. Lottie was naked now too, eyes steady on her.

“Come here.”

Natalie obeyed at once, moving to straddle Lottie where she sat back against the pillows. Her knees on either side of Lottie’s hips, hands braced on her shoulders.

Lottie’s hands slid up her thighs, then her waist. She guided Natalie down onto her, guiding her Natalie between them until her hand was slick against her. Lottie pressed two of her fingers into herself, then her own into Natalie again, filling both of them, knuckles pushing against each other, shared rhythm.

Natalie’s breath caught as she realized what Lottie was doing, how they were moving together now. Lottie’s voice dropped even lower. “We come together. Understand?”

“Yes Lottie.”

Lottie’s other hand gripped Natalie’s waist, holding her steady as they moved. Their foreheads touched. Natalie’s eyes fluttered shut again, her whole body shaking now as the pleasure built sharp and full.

“I love you.” Natalie gasped, voice cracking completely now. “I love you so much.”

Lottie’s grip tightened, voice rougher than before but still in control.
“I love you too, baby.”

"Lottie."

"I know baby, me too."

"Lottie."

"Yes Natalie. Now."

That was all it took. Natalie’s whole body shuddered as the orgasm hit her hard, breaking her open completely. At the same time, she felt Lottie flutter on her hand, her arm seizing tight around her waist, felt both of them tipping over the edge together.

They stayed like that, pressed together, shaking through it. Natalie felt her heart pounding against Lottie’s chest, her body trembling as she held onto her.

When it eased, when her breath steadied again, Lottie wrapped both arms around her and pulled her in tighter.

“Good girl.” Lottie murmured again, voice quieter now. Softer. “My perfect girl.”

Natalie pressed her face into her neck and moaned, eyes closed. She felt light. Empty in the best way. Filled up with only Lottie.

Lottie’s hand moved slowly through her hair again. “I know, baby.”

They stayed like that, tangled together in the quiet. Nothing left unsaid.
