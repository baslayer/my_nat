<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After breakfast Lottie suggested they do school work to get it out of the way so they could enjoy the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I only have one essay on Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. I can’t do it here, I have to go to the library.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you have to study for the vocab quiz? And didn’t you get your personal statement back?” Lottie knew what Natalie’s assignments were for English.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I got the essay back. I guess he didn’t really like it, though. He wants me to do it again.” She produced the sheet from her &lt;em&gt; Doing &lt;/em&gt; folder and showed it to Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Written on the front in heavy green ink, Mr. O’Neill had written, &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Very good try! Try again but make it more &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; personal &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; . It was great to read about your interests, but colleges want to know about &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; you &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; ! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie read over what Nat had written. “He’s got a point. You just kind of wrote about things you like.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat shrugged. “Isn’t that what he asked for?” She sighed. “I don’t really know what the point is anyway. I’m not applying to any colleges.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her sternly. “Natalie, you’re definitely going to apply to colleges, and you’re definitely going to have to do better than this when you apply for scholarships, too.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked at her, pleading. “&lt;em&gt; Lottie &lt;/em&gt;. I’m not going to get anything.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“How do you know that?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I just do.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even write a stupid essay about &lt;em&gt; myself &lt;/em&gt;. No one is going to give me shit, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Did you even try?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I mean. I did my bubble map, I planned what I wrote. I did it how they tell you to do it. And it still sucked.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Try again. But this time maybe think about &lt;em&gt; why &lt;/em&gt; you like those things. And don’t just write about things you like now, think about what you want in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie pulled a blank sheet of paper and wrote &lt;em&gt; Natalie &lt;/em&gt; in the middle. Then she drew three lines, each with their own bubble. In the three bubbles she wrote &lt;em&gt; Past, Present, &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Future. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Now on each of these bubbles, write at least two things that make you, you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She made two bullets under the &lt;em&gt; Present &lt;/em&gt; bubble and listed &lt;em&gt; Math &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Soccer &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Then when you write, don’t just say &lt;em&gt; what &lt;/em&gt; , explain &lt;em&gt; why &lt;/em&gt;. And do your best to make it, you know, stay focused on you. Does that make sense?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie looked at the paper with Lottie’s neat handwriting and perfect bubbles. “Yeah, I get it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Maybe just take your time and only focus on thinking of bullets for &lt;em&gt; Past &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Future &lt;/em&gt;, and when you’re done we can go over the vocab words and make flashcards. Ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat wanted deeply to make Lottie happy and successfully fill in the outline as she had suggested, but she didn’t have any clue what to write. Her future stood before her like a dark tunnel, and when she looked to her past, she only saw her dad. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She thought of Lottie and how easy it must’ve been for her to write about herself. She could write about divorce and an absent father, then about scholarship and her high academic and athletic achievements, and her future, probably as some high powered woman, running a company flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot, did you write one of these before?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes. I have written a few. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Can I read one? As an example?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, I don’t think so.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s &lt;em&gt; personal &lt;/em&gt;. I wrote about very personal things, things I don’t know if I want you to know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt as though she’d been stabbed. &lt;em&gt; She doesn’t want me to know. &lt;/em&gt; “Oh. Uh, are you supposed to write about things you don’t want people to know? Like someone &lt;em&gt; is &lt;/em&gt; going to read it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but the admissions people don’t &lt;em&gt; know &lt;/em&gt; you. They just want to understand what sets you apart as a potential student. It’s different if someone who knows who you are reads it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat thought about it. “If I write something I don’t want you to know, will you read it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course not.” She looked at her sympathetically. “If you want to keep it between you and Mr. O’Neill, that’s ok. He doesn’t have me grade essays, let alone personal statements. He just wants you to get practice.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Just try to be honest, Nat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;em&gt; Past &lt;/em&gt; bubble, Nat wrote &lt;em&gt; Dad &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Poor &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Looking at the future bubble she suddenly felt impossibly worse. &lt;em&gt; How the fuck am I supposed to know what is coming in the future &lt;/em&gt;? She groaned.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Lottie, what do I write for &lt;em&gt; Future &lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie sighed as she looked up from her own work. “I don’t know Nat. What do you want for the future?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat thought about it for a second. “Can you just tell me what they want me to say?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s not how it works. They’ll be able to tell if you write bullshit. So will Mr. O’Neill.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t &lt;em&gt; know. &lt;/em&gt; It’s literally the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Are you saying you don’t know what you want to happen to you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie put her forehead on the table and made a hard &lt;em&gt; thud &lt;/em&gt; against the wood.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do tomorrow?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I want to watch a movie with you, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie smiled at her. “Ok, what about next week?” Natalie didn’t hesitate. “I want to watch a movie with you every Sunday.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What about after we graduate, what do you want to do, then?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Uh-uh, this is about you. What do you want after we graduate?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.” Nat hadn’t ever thought about it. She tried to picture herself older, maybe in her twenties. “I guess it’d be cool to live in the city.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“There you go. Moving to New York is a big challenge and a good goal. You could write about that.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh wow, a kid from Jersey wants to move to the city. Thanks Lot. He’ll read that and know I’m probably gonna end up a bridge and tunnel girl for life.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Natalie, I can’t write this essay for you. You have to try to think about it and stop being so negative.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Sorry.” Nat turned away from her to look back at the sheet in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie felt bad then. “It’s ok, Nat. If it’s really too hard right now then just make the flashcards and then think about it while you do that. Sometimes it helps to busy yourself with something.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Thanks for your help.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat worked until Lottie walked up to her at the desk and gave her a kiss on the cheek. “I’m sorry, Nat. I can help you work on your essay later if that’s what you want.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thanks, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost noon. Are you going to go to Van’s?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really feel like it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Spending time with your friend might make you feel better.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“But I want to spend time with you.” She turned and looked at Lottie directly. “You’re so pretty.” She looked into her eyes and waited for the soothing effect to wash over her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; Lottie &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Go hang out with Van.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie kissed her on her forehead. “Good girl.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you Lottie”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie walked Nat to the door and gave her a deep kiss goodbye. “Call me if you want a ride or if you’re going to be late, ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“And Nat?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Be good.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie smiled and kissed her again. “I will.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat walked first to her place so she could take down Lottie’s phone number from her bedroom mirror. She wrote it in black marker on the inside of her arm.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then she walked over to the Van’s trailer and found her friend already at work. On a card table on her lot, Van had the equipment opened up so that the internal electronics were exposed. She had wire cutters, a patinated soldering iron, and a multimeter on the table, among other tools, fluids, and towels.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What’s up Nat!” Van was clearly energized and excited about the job before her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Van, how’s it comin?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s looking good. I just finished cleaning shit up and now I’m checking the parts… looks like the Pioneer capacitors went bad and the turntable just needs some new cables. We should be ready to rock in no time.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Cool. What do you want me to do?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you be a &lt;em&gt; good girl &lt;/em&gt; and go get us some beers from the fridge” Van side eyed her. Nat stuck out her tongue and went.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Nat returned, she handed a beer to Van, sat on a lawn chair, and lit a cigarette. Van didn’t waste any time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“So… how’s &lt;em&gt; Lottie &lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She’s good.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“And how’s the tongue fucking?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Dude, shut up!”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What, I thought you’d be proud of yourself. She looked pretty happy about it yesterday.” Van raised an eyebrow at her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat blushed and hesitated but ultimately gave in. “It was pretty good.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s the spirit. You like making your girlfriend happy?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She’s, uh, not my girlfriend.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van laughed at that. “Wow, you had me fooled.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Dude, if she’s not your girlfriend then what the fuck is she?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat tried to answer the question for herself. She thought about her constantly. She wanted to be with her all the time. She wanted to do whatever she said.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lottie is everything. &lt;/em&gt;“I don’t know dude. We haven’t, like, talked about it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well what do you guys talk about?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. School mostly. Sometimes she, like…” Nat stopped herself.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“She what?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, Nat, what were you gonna say?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes she helps me with like, stuff. I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know… like this morning. We were working on homework and I had to rewrite my personal essay and she gave me advice on how to do it. But sometimes it’s, you know, other stuff, too. Not just school stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No actually, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat tried to search for a specific example of Lottie helping her outside of school. When she did, though, she failed. She found she was only left with the impression that Lottie was helping her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s just kind of like, this general feeling. Ever since we started hanging out, it’s like, I know what I’m supposed to do, and I know it’s because of her.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van looked at her skeptically. “That helps you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, totally. I don’t know, it just feels right.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sounds weird to me dude.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I guess I’m just not explaining it right.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van let a few beats pass as she focused on her work. Nat watched as she worked systematically, removing screws and putting them in tiny bowls. She admired Van’s focus and her apparent confidence in her process.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“How do you know what you need to do?” Nat asked about the repairs, but Van heard a deeper question.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know dude. I guess I think about what I want and what I have to do to get there, you know? Like soccer. I want us to win Nationals, so I go to practice every day.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat didn’t remark on the misinterpreted question. She thought about Van’s answer, and then about the essay she needed to write.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What if you don’t know what you want?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I have to write this like, personal statement for Mr. O’Neill and it’s supposed to be a college admission practice thing and Lottie told me I should try to write about what I want in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to go to college?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lottie said I would apply to college. &lt;/em&gt;“I don’t know”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s the problem, Van. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;don’t know.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van looked at her. “Is everything ok, Nat?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; I don’t know &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van returned to focus on her work again and chewed on Nat’s answer. After a few minutes, Van began again, “what did you mean, at the diner yesterday, when you said last Friday was crazy?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat hesitated. After she had cried in Lottie’s car she had avoided thinking about it. “It was just like, a lot. I don’t know”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van didn’t press to try to give Nat space to work out what she wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat continued, “I had this meeting with Colburn and he was telling me I was out of absences, so I kinda decided I wanted to just drop out.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“But you didn’t?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No… I mean. I almost did. I saw Lottie in the hall when I was trying to leave and she got mad at me and tried to get me to go to class but like, I didn’t want to. Then she tried to tell me to go get burgers with you guys and gave me her number so I could let her know when I was out of detention.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van nodded along as she kept her eyes on her work. “Yeah, I mean. She was at practice and she was talking about how you might go and then she was kinda down when you never paged her.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat pictured a disappointed Lottie and immediately felt guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It kinda gets worse.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Go on.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“So then I went to Kevyn’s instead and did like, a lot of drugs. More than I’ve ever done probably. There was so much. I lost track.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh shit.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, and then I guess I freaked out and I &lt;em&gt; called Lottie &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ooohhh.” Van raised her head in understanding. “This is starting to make some sense.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah so like, Lottie picked me up and kind of you know, &lt;em&gt; saved &lt;/em&gt; me. I don’t really remember a lot after the car ride, and even that’s fuzzy, but I woke up in her house and I wasn’t, y’know, dead.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry dude. That sounds like a hard night. I’m glad Lottie came through for you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Totally. It’s like, I don’t know what would’ve happened if I hadn’t had her number.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van nodded with satisfaction. “Heavy, man.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” Nat paused and considered whether she wanted to continue. &lt;em&gt; This feels good. &lt;/em&gt; “So then when I got home I went back to sleep and woke up the next morning and I just, y’know, went back to Lottie’s.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Florence Nightingale syndrome?” Van smirked.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It’s like when you fall in love with your nurse or something. Nevermind, it was just a joke. You can keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat laughed. “Yeah I mean, it was kinda like that. When I woke up on Sunday I just like, &lt;em&gt; had &lt;/em&gt;to go on a run and go back to Lottie’s. Then when I got there, she had this big ass breakfast just, like ready for me. We ate and then we watched a movie and then we made out and it’s just been like, all about her since then.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What movie did you watch?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why does that matter?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Whatever dude, I just like movies.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Interview with a Vampire.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh shit, that’s a good one to make out to. Lots of like, gay subtext. Good choice.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it was like, really good dude.” Nat thought back to the feeling of kissing Lottie for the first time. &lt;em&gt; Wow. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“So she kissed you and then convinced you to come back to school and the team? Sounds like she’s doing the lord’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie nodded but she suddenly felt like there was a gap in her memory. &lt;em&gt; When did Lottie convince me to go back to school? &lt;/em&gt; She decided not to mention the forgotten detail to Van.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah and all week she’s just been helping me a lot with getting my school work done. I was at her house almost every day.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“And you guys &lt;em&gt; kissed &lt;/em&gt; some more, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat laughed at her then thought again of the day in her bedroom. Then the night in Lottie’s bed. Then finally of going down on her. Her own arousal made her uncomfortable thinking about it in Van’s presence, and she resolved to not give more details. Partially out of the awkwardness, but also out of respect for Lottie. &lt;em&gt; Too private. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Well I guess mystery solved, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat laughed at her. “What mystery?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Why you like, became a different person over night, dude. You had a come-to-Jesus moment, but Lottie was your Jesus.” She smirked at her. “I’d be in love with Jesus too if she were some hot tall girl with looks to kill.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat smiled at Van’s recognition of Lottie’s attractiveness. &lt;em&gt; Her eyes. &lt;/em&gt;“You think I’m in love?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sure sounds like it to me. You don’t think so?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van let it go. “One more beer and I’ll be done. Are you empty too?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat rose to retrieve another round. She thought about Van’s comment. She thought of how it felt to look at Lottie, to sink into her. &lt;em&gt; Is that love? &lt;/em&gt; When she posed the question to herself she realized she had no idea what love was, or was supposed to be, what it felt like, or what it was supposed to feel like.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Alone in the kitchen, she thought of how it felt to be &lt;em&gt; with &lt;/em&gt; Lottie, how sometimes it felt like she was… elsewhere. &lt;em&gt; Is that what it’s supposed to be like? &lt;/em&gt; The feeling was so different and more intense than anything she had ever felt, even sexually with other people- an impossible level of bliss. Almost like an out-of-body experience. &lt;em&gt; Rapture &lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She sighed and settled on not being sure. She decided it didn’t matter because whatever it was she felt, it felt good, and putting a name to it wasn’t important to her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She brought Van her beer and changed gears. “So what about you, Van, any new notches in the bedpost?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van smirked at her as she sipped. “I’m not supposed to talk about it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Come on dude, I just like, spilled my guts. You owe me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Promise not to tell anyone?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Who am I going to tell?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Van gave her a direct look. “I can think of someone.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh come on, I can keep a secret.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok… well…” Van took a deep breath and looked in the opposite direction dramatically. “&lt;em&gt; I’m &lt;/em&gt; in love.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Who is it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Tai.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Shut up. Tai on the team?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No, the other Tai.” Van smiled at her. “Yeah, Tai on the team.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Since when?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“This summer I guess. You were like, totally MIA, and I ended up hanging out with her a lot. One thing led to another and… now I just, y’know, really like her.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s great Van.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. It is. It’s just like, I don’t know about her parents and like, she seems really kinda… in the closet.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah I mean, we’ve talked a lot about it and I get it that it’s already hard for her. But I just wish I could be kissing her all the time and holding her hand. Like you and Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry dude. That sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah…” Van was starting to put screws back in their places. “Maybe one day we can all hang out. I’ll ask Tai if she’d be ok with that.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat clinked her beer against Van’s. “Here’s to asking permission.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Van finished up they spent a long afternoon drinking and listening to music. When it got late, Nat asked to use Van’s phone to call Lottie for a ride home.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie came to get her in short time, and when she arrived Van welcomed her warmly and offered her a beer. They all sat, smoking, drinking, and enjoying one another’s company until the wee hours of the morning. When Lottie looked at her watch and noted the time, they said their goodbyes. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Nat, can you leave me and Lottie alone for a sec. I want to talk to her about something.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Uh, ok. Can I get the keys Lot?” She went to wait in the car.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie started. “What is it Van?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I, uh, well. Nat told me what you did and I just y’know… wanted to thank you. For taking care of my friend last week.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Oh. Um. Of course.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you really like her?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Look, it’s like… Nat can tell you on her own, but like, she’s been through a lot dude.” Van looked at her seriously. “And she says you’re doing so much to help her get right and thank you for all that too, but, like, if you ever do anything to hurt her...”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok Van”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You get it? I’ll fucking end you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Got it.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok. Drive safe Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Will do. Good night Van.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
