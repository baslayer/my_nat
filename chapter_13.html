<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat walked home in a state of abject dejection. Every word Lottie had said to her repeated in her mind. She dwelled on the situation and felt it building and tangling upon itself, collecting into a morass that left her completely adrift in confusion. She wanted so much to understand what Lottie wanted from her. As she walked the route from the estate to the trailer park, she felt as though she’d been cast out, like a stray dog that had been brought into the house but then had been put out onto the street again. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Her mind searched for something true and knowable to fight the feeling. She thought of geometry and trigonometry, and craved the clarity of the proofs and definitions of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she got home, she paged Lottie to signal that she’d arrived and then went to her room and took out her notebook. She tore a sheet and drew a line down the center of the page. At the top of the left side, she wrote &lt;em&gt; Statement &lt;/em&gt; and on the right side she wrote &lt;em&gt; Proof. &lt;/em&gt;She nodded to herself, already feeling the comfort of the reasoning process.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She wrote first, &lt;em&gt; Lottie makes me happy. &lt;/em&gt; She felt warmth seeing it on the page, as though it being written made it more tangible. She wrote to the right, &lt;em&gt; When I’m with her, I feel good. &lt;/em&gt; She nodded. That seemed right..&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She continued.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; Lottie cares about me. – She helps me when I ask. She gives me advice.  &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; Lottie likes me. – She spends time with me. She acts the same in front of people. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; Lottie wants me to be good. – She is upset when I do something wrong. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stopped and focused on the idea of what it meant for something to be &lt;em&gt; wrong &lt;/em&gt;. She attempted to chain the idea to the next logical statement.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; I know right from wrong. – When I do something wrong, Lottie is upset. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stared at the circular proof. &lt;em&gt; Well that can’t be right. &lt;/em&gt; She thought on it, and tried to zero in on the contradiction that was at the center of her current malaise. She tried to write a logical progression to bring it to life.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; Lottie is happy when I’m good. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; Lottie is not happy that I want her to be happy. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; It’s not good that I want Lottie to be happy. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; If I’m not good, Lottie is unhappy. &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stared, trying to make sense of it. The more she tried to think through a solution that would reconcile the idea that Lottie wouldn’t want her to reciprocate the desire for happiness, the more confused she felt. She thought there must be a missing piece of information, something that would untangle the contradiction. She sighed, put the paper on her dresser, and lied down.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She tried to push thoughts of Lottie out of her head but found she couldn’t. She was the only thing there, and Nat suddenly felt a certain helplessness at her inability to will her own mind to think about something else. She decided it was something like her addict behavior. If she wasn’t with Lottie, she was thinking of her. When she gave in for a moment and stopped trying to control her train of thought she felt it quickly spin out of control yet converge over and over on her- &lt;em&gt; Lottie, Lottie, Lottie. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She crushed her eyes together and tried to focus on something- anything else. She went to the Unit Circle, but then Lottie was there again showing it to her. She thought of Van, but Lottie was there, too. Kevyn- Lottie. Soccer- Lottie. School- Lottie. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She groaned. She looked at her alarm clock- &lt;em&gt; 12:30 &lt;/em&gt;. She considered for a minute just packing up for school the next day and going back to her place, but knew she couldn’t because Lottie had told her she needed to sleep at home. She wished for sleep, for her mind to ease so she could relax into restful unconsciousness. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When she closed her eyes, she saw her immediately. She sighed and hummed her name, “&lt;em&gt; Lottie”. &lt;/em&gt; She looked at her behind her lids and saw her face clearly, and looked deep into her eyes. “ &lt;em&gt; So pretty. &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She stopped trying to make sense of her feelings and instead just let them wash over her as she imagined Lottie’s gaze upon her. “&lt;em&gt; It feels good. &lt;/em&gt; ” The soothing pleasure coursed through her as the words left her mouth. She heard her voice, &lt;em&gt; I know you like being good for me Natalie.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; “I’m so good for you.”  &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; That’s right, you’re my good girl.  &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;em&gt; “I’m your good girl.”  &lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat sighed peacefully. She felt the truth of the words deep in her. She continued to let imagination work, playing her voice like a lullaby, easing her into the dreamworld.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat woke up before the radio alarm sounded. She looked at the clock- &lt;em&gt; 4:45. &lt;/em&gt; She felt grateful for the sleep she had gotten and had no desire to fight to get some more. She rose and immediately started her routine. She ran, showered, dressed, and ate. She checked the alarm again- &lt;em&gt; 6:15. &lt;/em&gt;She looked from it to the sheet of paper on her dresser. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She picked it up and read it over and briefly thought about the night she’d had trying to be reasonable about Lottie and how much easier it was to not be. She looked at her notes and the hopelessness of trying to converge on a logical solution became apparent to her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In a moment of boldness, she packed a duffel bag with more of her clothes and left for Lottie’s house. On the walk she thought of how people talk about love and how they say it can make you feel crazy, illogical. She thought of Van’s questioning and how &lt;em&gt; she’d &lt;/em&gt; thought Nat had been acting. She thought of how she was in that moment thinking of Lottie, and it made her think of Lottie even more. She pictured herself standing between two mirrors, their reflections repeating endlessly in both directions, echoing thoughts of Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She rang the doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;A member of the staff answered the door and recognized her. “Good morning, Natalie. Come in. I believe Miss Matthews is in her room. I’ll go get her for you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She went into the living room and looked around at the space she now knew well. She took a seat on her divan and waited.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Lottie came down, she stood.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good morning, Natalie.” She approached her and kissed Nat’s forehead. “Is everything ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked up at her and into her eyes, and immediately felt herself slipping. “I… uh… I wanted… to…” She crushed her eyes closed and shook her head. “Can you, um, turn around?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie let out a small laugh. “Ok…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat turned around too and so they were standing back to back. She took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Lottie, I am always thinking about you. I think about you so much. Sometimes it makes me feel, like, crazy. I want to be around you, I want to listen to you, I want to make you so happy. I know how it sounds and I know it hasn’t been a long time, but I think I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie was silent. Nat breathed again and continued.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I like who I am when I’m with you. I want to be with you, all the time.” Nat’s heart was pounding. Lottie could feel it hammering through her ribcage against her back. “Lottie, will you be my girlfriend?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;A long silence hung in the air. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Lottie? Did I say something wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok… well will you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie sighed and stayed silent. “Natalie… I…”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The tone of her voice sent Nat into a tailspin. &lt;em&gt; She hates me. This is it. She doesn’t want me here. Stupid! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry Lot.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What? No. I… Natalie… I love you too. It’s just… I don’t know if we &lt;em&gt; should &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat felt the confusion of contradiction again. “Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Because… um… well. I think you’re going through a hard time right now. And maybe it’s not a good idea to be in a relationship when you’re trying to get better.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to be with me because I’m a drug addict.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No! No Natalie, I &lt;em&gt; do &lt;/em&gt; want to be with you. I just… I just don’t know if it’s right.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“I’m so fucking confused Lottie. If you want to be with me, then why wouldn’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie heard Lottie sigh deeply. “Lot, I don’t know what’s going through your head right now but last night… I was trying to make things make sense. And then when I stopped I just felt so much better.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; Natalie &lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt; Lottie. &lt;/em&gt; Please?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie heard the unevenness in Lottie’s breathing and felt nervousness emanating from the tall girl. She reached behind her and took Lottie’s hand to her mouth and kissed it. “Please, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok, Nat.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Can I turn around now?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yeah”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When Lottie turned she brought Nat into a tight embrace. She kissed the top of her head and then rested her chin upon it. “Are you ok, Natalie?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“So good. Thank you Lot. Thank you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome, Natalie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hey Lot? Can I ask you something else?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“What is it?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie leaned back and looked at her. She gazed into her, searching for the place in the darkness behind her eyes. “Can I stay here with you?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Of course you can. You can be here, always.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Always.&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;b&gt;“Thank you.”&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie guided her down onto the divan so that they were sitting together and brought her head to her shoulder. She stroked her hair and sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Natalie, I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I want you to remember I love you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was floating. “I love you too Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They sat like that for a while until Lottie looked at her watch and took a deep breath. “Are you ready to go to school?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Ok, it’s time to go.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When they got into the car, Nat took Lottie’s hand and held it in her lap. She let it go when they arrived so they could get out of the car, and then took it again as they walked to the classroom. When she took her seat, she reluctantly let it go again and thought immediately of when she’d hold it next. She took her vocab quiz and thought of how easy it was, and how grateful she felt towards Lottie for reminding her to study.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;After detention she went to health and waited for Lottie to arrive. When she did she stood and kissed her on the mouth in greeting. “Hey Lot.” When they sat she took Lottie’s hand in hers again and felt the relief of completeness spread through her. When class ended, she walked Lottie upstairs to her French class. She kissed her goodbye, and went to class. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;When the last period of the day ended, she mapped the route Lottie would take from the French classroom to the locker room in her head, and endeavored to find her. When she did, she saw she was with Jackie. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Bonjour, &lt;em&gt; Nathalie &lt;/em&gt;.” She pronounced her name with a French accent. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Hi Jackie.” She turned to face Lottie. “Hey Lot. How was class?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Très bien, ma cherie.” She kissed her. “How was yours?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It was ok. DeMartino is a trip.” She looked up into her intentionally. “I missed you.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Geeze Nat, aren’t you both in Shauna’s health class? You were just together.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie turned her attention to Jackie, “My girlfriend is allowed to miss me, Jackie, even if it’s only for an hour and half.” &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat smiled big at Lottie’s openness. “Thanks, Lot. Can you remind coach I’m going to the help hour please?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Um, hello!” Jackie waved her hand. “Team captain here? You can tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat looked away from Lottie and to Jackie, as if she were just reminded that she were there. “Oh, um. Ok. I’m going to the help hour, I’ll be at practice later.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Jackie crossed her arms in satisfaction. “Ok, good. See you then” She hooked her arm in Lottie’s and started to walk them both to the locker room. Lottie turned herself around and waved goodbye to Nat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;In the help hour, she was amicable and patient with the students who came in for help. She enjoyed herself and did her best to impart the affection she felt for the elegance of the logic onto the students who did not yet grasp it. She thought of Lottie and how she had treated her when she was helping with her work, and tried to act in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She finished and went to soccer, then back home with Lottie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She sat at her desk and did her assignments. She finished them quickly and asked Lottie if there was anything she needed her to do. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“No Natalie, I’m ok. Thank you”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“How did your test go today?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“It was good. I think I did well. I talked to Shauna about it and we came up with a lot of the same answers, so that’s usually a good sign.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Good.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for asking.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Natalie made dinner and set the table and went back up to the bedroom where she found Lottie working at the desk. She laid in the bed and waited until she was finished.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Over dinner she talked about how good it felt to be able to help the students at the help hour. “I thought about you, Lot, and how much you help me. It was nice to be able to help the other kids.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“That’s wonderful Nat. I’m happy you get to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Do you ever feel like you need help?”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“All the time.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat was surprised by her answer. “Really? You always seem so… confident.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I think it helps to act a certain way until I feel it instead of waiting to feel it for real.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Nat thought about it and understood. “If you ever need help, Lot, don’t act like you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Lottie looked at her with a specific softness that was new and vulnerable. Nat felt the soothing penetration of her gaze and savored it. “Lottie, I… I uh, I want to make you happy.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Natalie. You're so good for me.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;“You’re welcome, Lottie.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">When they went to bed, Lottie brought Nat into a tight embrace. She held her close so that she could feel her heart against her chest, and waited until she heard it slow. When it did, she whispered into the sleeping girl’s ear “&lt;em&gt;My Natalie. &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
