  <p>Natalie kept her focus straight ahead as Lottie drove them to practice. She watched as she made the turns that took them back to the school. </p>

  <p>
    <em> We’re going to practice now. </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>Her head felt like an empty cave with the one phrase echoing off its walls. But it wasn’t fading like an echo would. It only bounced around endlessly, loudly, overwhelming the questions that were brewing in her.</p>
  
  <p><em>Were we just…</em> <em>We’re going to practice now. We were on my bed… We’re going to practice now. Did I… We’re going to practice now. </em></p>
  
  <p>She felt a headache brewing as she tried to force herself past the phrase that rang behind her ears. Her skin felt irradiated. Lottie reached over and took her hand in her own, keeping her own gaze ahead. Nat looked down at her hand as it burned under the other girl’s touch, then up to Lottie, and back down to the hand.</p>
  
  <p>She grasped Lottie’s hand and felt physical relief as she squeezed. Her breathing was even and she felt relaxed, but the echoing in her mind persisted and she felt a disembodied foreboding with her inability to drown it out. <em> We’re going to practice now. </em></p>
  
  <p>She opened her mouth to ask Lottie a question, but it left her as soon as it formed. She closed her mouth again.</p>
  
  <p>“You’re ok, Nat.” Nat thought Lottie sounded… <em> We’re going to practice now. </em> She sighed. She didn’t know.</p>
  
  <p>Natalie followed Lottie from the car as though she were tethered to her. She followed a step behind, keeping a steady gait that mirrored the girl’s ahead of her. When they arrived at the area where the other girls were stretching and chatting, Lottie greeted them with Nat by her side.</p>
  
  <p>“If it isn’t the queen and her page.” Van teased them as she performed a theatrical bow. She looked at her friend and waited for her to return fire but only saw Nat staring past her, seemingly focused on something in the distance. Van turned to look behind her in dramatic fashion then back at Nat. “Whatya looking at Nat?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat shifted her gaze to Van and furrowed her brow, as if she was trying to figure it out herself. “I, uh… I’m…” </p>
  
  <p>“Come on Nat, let’s stretch.” Lottie interrupted her trailing off. Nat felt relief as she stopped trying to answer Van and followed Lottie’s direction. She nodded, turned her eyes to the ground, and brought her leg up behind her. <em> 1… 2… 3… 4… </em>The counting came easy to her.</p>
  
  <p>Shauna was the first to speak again. “So Jax, do you think Scatorccio’s going to make the team?” She kept her eyes on the dazed blonde, waiting for a reaction that never came. <em> 18… 19… 20… 21… </em></p>
  
  <p>“He told me she was lethal at tryouts yesterday. She might not be as rusty as we thought.” Jackie looked at Nat, too now. There was no evidence that she registered the accolade. </p>
  
  <p>“Ok ladies, let’s get it going!” Coach started to make his announcements. “... and Scatorccio! You’ll still be with us today.” Nat looked up at Lottie who nodded at her before she ran off to the far end of the field with the rest of the team. Nat felt the tether grow taught with their distance and then snap as she turned her attention back toward coach.</p>
  
  <p>Tryouts began with laps followed by sprints. By the time they were lining up for drills, Nat was starting to feel clarified by the physical activity. She watched Lottie at practice across the field as she heard her thoughts begin to swirl in her mind. She tried to piece together what had transpired between them. <em> We went to my house. We changed clothes. We made out. She was on top of me. And then…  </em></p>
  
  <p>She felt the implication of what came next low in her stomach. The gathering wet made her uncomfortable in the athletic setting she was in at that moment. She tried to shake the feeling and return her focus to the drills, but the mystery lingered in the back of her mind. <em> Get it together, Scatorrcio. </em></p>
  
  <p>She managed to get through the tryout, albeit less skillfully than the day before. She changed into her shoes and walked off the field. She felt the choice in front of her like it was a brick wall: <em> do I stay or do I go home now? </em></p>
  
  <p>A lack of will prevented her from deciding one way or another. <em> My backpack </em> . It was in Lottie’s car. She felt relief at the realization. <em> I’ll wait </em>. So she turned around and went back to the bench and waited and tried to think some more.</p>
  
  <p><em> We went to my house. We changed clothes. We made out. She was on top of me. And then… she was looking at me. </em> A chill went down her spine and she felt the arousal pool between her legs again. <em> She’s so beautiful. Did I really come from looking at her? </em></p>
  
  <p>She looked across the field at Lottie and watched her. She tried to think about the day before, tried to figure out how much time had passed until varsity practice had ended. <em> How much longer? </em></p>
  
  <p>The more she dwelled on trying to piece together the events of the afternoon, the more the heat grew in her. She was sure there was something more than she was able to remember but thinking about it felt risky there on the bench. She shifted in her seat and crossed her legs deliberately, tightly. She wanted to get back somewhere private.</p>
  
  <p>As an act of retreat, she decided to go smoke to try to clear her mind. She took a deep breath and took the pack from Lottie’s bag and made her way to the bleachers. She smoked 3 cigarettes in succession as she had the day before, in a bid to pass the time in the same way. She didn’t watch the practice, though, instead she thought of her circle and the steps she took to create it.</p>
  
  <p>In her head, she folded the paper long ways and short, then used the ruler to make the cross in the circle along the folds. She took her protractor and lined it up at the center. She made marks in the first quadrant,<em> 30-45-60. </em>She rotated the page 90°, and repeated the marks in the second, then in the third, then the fourth. She drew diameter lines across the circle, connecting her marks. She labeled the degree measures, then the radian measures, then the cartesian coordinates. </p>
  
  <p>She placed the paper to the side and did it again.</p>
  
  <p>The systematic process soothed her. </p>
  
  <p>When she finished her third cigarette she emerged from the bleachers to find a sparse group of girls remaining, Lottie not among them. She went to the car and found her there. Lottie watched her approach with arms crossed, apparently waiting for her.</p>
  
  <p>When Nat looked at her she felt the pull of her gaze again. <em> No. </em> She looked away and fixed her eyes on the ground. “Hey Lot.” </p>
  
  <p>“Hi Natalie, are you ready to go?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.” She made herself say it because she knew it’s what Lottie wanted her to say. She didn’t feel ready for anything. </p>
  
  <p>In the car again, she began to feel herself become aware of the intensity of Lottie’s presence. Goosebumps formed along her arm at the nearness of the girl's hand. She breathed in the sweet musk of her perspiration. She found it hard to form a thought that didn’t revolve around the girl next to her. </p>
  
  <p>“What are you going to work on today?” Lottie broke the palpable silence.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, I, uh…” She thought of the circle. “I could do the trig work.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie nodded in approval. “Don’t forget Mr. O’Neill wants you to get your personal statement in by the end of the week. You’ll have to do it today or tomorrow.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok I’ll try it today.”</p>
  
  <p>“Good.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat smiled. <em> Good. </em></p>
  
  <p>“I think you should probably try to do at least one other assignment. You have a lot to get done and you worked for over four hours last night. I think you can do it.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>When they arrived at the house, Lottie led her up to the room and showed her to her desk. “I’ll be right back. I got you something.”</p>
  
  <p>She returned with a brand-new text book.<em> College Trigonometry, Third Edition. </em></p>
  
  <p>“I thought you could use a better reference than the Britannica.” She set the book on the desk in front of her.</p>
  
  <p>“<em> Lottie.” </em> Nat looked up at her. “I’m not in college.”</p>
  
  <p>“I know, Natalie. I had to go to the bookstore at the junior college this morning to get it. There aren’t many places you can just go get math textbooks.”</p>
  
  <p>“But…” She ran her fingertips over the glossy hardcover. “I don’t know what to say. Are you giving this to me?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>Natalie had never owned a book before. She loved it. There was a tightness in her chest and she swallowed hard. She tried to will the emotions welling up behind her eyes back down, but soon she was crying. She couldn’t put any of it together. The deferene she felt towards Lottie, the care Lottie showed her, now this gift that didn’t feel like any gift she’d ever gotten. It made her feel inhuman and human at the same time in a way that was irreconcilable.</p>
  
  <p>“Oh, Natalie. It’s ok” Lottie placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t know what’s going on.” Natalie spoke looking straight through the windows as tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
  
  <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
  
  <p>“I… it’s just… this book. Why do I love a <em> book </em> about <em> math </em>? I don’t feel like me.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled at her, like she was talking to a child. “Well then who do you feel like?”</p>
  
  <p>“I feel like someone I don’t really know.” <em> There it was. </em> Nat felt a pang of satisfaction as she put her proverbial finger on the feeling of foreboding in her.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her pitifully. “Well maybe you’re overthinking it. Maybe you just like math now. Maybe you always did but just didn’t know. People learn new things about themselves all the time.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat nodded slowly and tried the idea out in her head. <em> Maybe I just like math now. </em></p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok? I’m going to start my work now. Let’s try to work for at least two hours and then we can check in.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat breezed through the trig identity exercises with her new book. She found that she genuinely enjoyed looking through the sections and reviewing the examples. The more she read and understood the calmer she felt about her own uneasiness. <em> Maybe Lottie’s right. I do like this. </em> </p>
  
  <p>When she finished, she took out a blank sheet of paper from the drawer and started to map an outline for her personal essay. <em> This is dumb </em>. </p>
  
  <p>She drew a circle in the middle of the page and wrote in the middle <em> Me </em> . She drew three lines extending from it, each with their own circles at the end. Without thinking about it, in the first circle she wrote <em> Lottie. </em></p>
  
  <p>She stared at it. She erased it. <em> You can’t write about a girl in your personal essay.  </em></p>
  
  <p>Then she was stumped. <em> Can’t write about partying either. </em></p>
  
  <p>In the first circle over the erased name, she wrote <em> Math. </em>She nodded. That felt right.</p>
  
  <p>Then in the second circle, now with some momentum, she wrote <em> Soccer. </em> </p>
  
  <p>At the third and final circle she hesitated. She thought of her dad and the rifle. <em> Can’t write about trying to kill your dad. </em>She tapped the eraser on the table, then stuck it in her mouth and chewed. “Hey Lot, can you help me?”</p>
  
  <p>“What is it, Nat?”</p>
  
  <p>“I can’t come up with a third thing about me for my personal essay.”</p>
  
  <p>“What do you have so far?”</p>
  
  <p>“Math and Soccer.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie smiled at her. “So you <em> do </em> like math now?”</p>
  
  <p>“Well I can’t write about coke so it’s the next best thing.” Nat wanted to push her buttons.</p>
  
  <p>“Ha, ha.” She stuck out her tongue. “Can’t write about smoking either, so I guess you’re stuck, huh?”</p>
  
  <p>“Thanks for the help.” Nat turned back to the page. </p>
  
  <p>After some minutes of thinking about the past few days, she decided on a topic for the third bubble: <em>Music.</em> With the outline complete, the essay flowed out of her easily. She counted the words on each line and then added them up in the margin, <em>712.</em> <em>Nice.</em> </p>
  
  <p>She placed the essay and the worksheets in her <em> Done </em> folder. She went back to the <em> To Do </em> folder and took out a packet for her Spanish class and got to work with a Spanish-English dictionary that was on Lottie’s desk. When she finished, she placed the assignment in the <em> Done </em> folder, fully satisfied. </p>
  
  <p>She sat there for a second before alerting Lottie that she had finished. She realized doing her homework <em> did </em> make her feel better, in more than one way. There was a sense of completion and accomplishment, feelings of capability and aptitude that affirmed her. A lot of things felt confusing to her lately, but when she did her school work that all felt drowned out and inconsequential.  </p>
  
  <p>She stood up and went over to sit with Lottie on the bed. She had a book open on the bed in front of her, a smaller book held in one hand, and a pen and notes to her side. “Whatcha doin, Lot?”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m reading and annotating a play for English.”</p>
  
  <p>“What’s the play?”</p>
  
  <p>“Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw. We have to read it and compare it to the story as told by Ovid. </p>
  
  <p>“Is it about a pig?” Nat teased.</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her from lowered eyes, her chin still facing the book. “No, it’s about an English professor of phonetics who tries to teach a poor flower girl how to speak properly.”</p>
  
  <p>“Sounds boring.”</p>
  
  <p>“It’s not. The original story by Ovid is better, but this one is still pretty good. It became a play and a movie- <em> My Fair Lady </em>.”</p>
  
  <p>“Never heard of it.”</p>
  
  <p>“Is there something you need Natalie?”</p>
  
  <p>“No, I just… I’m done.”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her watch. “Ok I can wrap it up here, too. Let’s eat dinner.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>They ate and had an after dinner cigarette. Lottie looked at her watch. “It’s almost 9. Do you want me to take you home?”</p>
  
  <p>Nat looked at Lottie for a cue, but Lottie wasn’t looking at her. She considered it, and decided she would rather sleep in Lottie’s bed again. “Can we go to my place so I can get some clothes for tomorrow, then come back here?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie looked at her then. Natalie felt her eyes penetrate her, searching for something behind her own. </p>
  
  <p>“Sure. Let’s go.”</p>
  
  <p>When they got to the trailer, Lottie stayed in the car to wait for her. Inside Natalie slid past her mom and went straight to her room. She gathered clothes for sleep, school, and soccer into a duffel bag, and then went to the bathroom for her toiletries and shower soaps. When she came out she offered a simple “bye mom”.</p>
  
  <p>“Wait, Nattie! Where ya goin?”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m staying the night at my friend’s house.”</p>
  
  <p>“You goin to Kevyn’s?”</p>
  
  <p>“No.” She rolled her eyes.</p>
  
  <p>“Is it that Lottie girl?”</p>
  
  <p>“Ya” Nat was getting impatient. She had her hand on the doorknob.</p>
  
  <p>“Are you ok, Nattie?”</p>
  
  <p>“Ya mom, I’m fine. Can I go now? She’s waiting for me outside.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok Nattie. Goodnight.”</p>
  
  <p> </p>
  
  <p>Back at the Matthews’ they took turns showering and got ready for bed. “Are you going to play the piano tonight?” Natalie was hopeful.</p>
  
  <p>“Not tonight, Natalie. I’m really tired, I’ve got a lot on my mind.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat realized for all the care that Lottie had shown her, she hadn’t done much to reciprocate. She felt a pang of shame. <em> What would Lottie tell me to do? </em> “Maybe paying will make you feel better.”</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t think so Nat.”</p>
  
  <p>“Do you want to watch a movie?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. I think I just want to go to bed.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ok.”</p>
  
  <p>Nat followed Lottie into bed and held her until she fell asleep. Nat herself didn’t yet feel the pull of sleep, though. She let go and turned onto her back in the bed. She looked at Lottie next to her and back at the ceiling. She tried to piece together more of the afternoon.</p>
  
  <p><em> We went to my house. We changed clothes. We made out. She was on top of me. She was looking at me. </em>She felt the heat pooling again in her stomach, low and insistent. She exhaled and looked again at Lottie. “Hey Lot?” she whispered, “Are you asleep?”</p>
  
  <p>Lottie didn’t respond to her. The room was quiet. She tried to think again. <em> We were on my bed. She was on top of me. She was looking at me. </em> She pressed her thighs together in search of friction. All of a sudden she felt… excited. She held her eyes on Lottie now. She was breathing deeply, slowly, in a deep sleep. </p>
  
  <p><em> She was on top of me. She was looking at me. </em> She traced her fingers along the curve of her stomach and felt her breath hitch at the sensation. She kept eyes on Lottie as she reached below her waistband and felt herself. <em> Oh fuck. </em> She felt obscene and lascivious teasing herself next to the dark haired girl. <em> I’m so wet for you Lot. </em></p>
  
  <p><em> She was on top of me. She was looking at me. </em>She closed her eyes and imagined Lottie on top of her again. She saw her staring down at her. She pushed her fingers inside her to mirror Lottie’s stare.</p>
  
  <p><em> Good girl. It’s building in you now. </em>She heard Lottie say it. </p>
  
  <p>She pumped faster, putting pressure on her clit. <em> I’m a good girl and I want to come. </em>It almost escaped her lips.</p>
  
  <p>She felt possessed, outside of herself. She relaxed into the feeling. She let herself pretend her hand wasn’t her own, that she was outside of her own body, that she wasn’t under her own control.</p>
  
  <p><em> You’re close now. </em> She heard Lottie say it. <em> I’m close now. </em></p>
  
  <p>She took the orgasm silently as she felt her walls spasm against her hand. Wet spilled down her fingers as warm waves of pleasure washed over her. </p>
  
  <p>She lay there for a moment, her mind pleasantly quiet in a state of bliss. She looked again at Lottie and felt a pang of shame. <em> That wasn’t very good of you Natalie. </em> She chastised herself but heard it in Lottie’s voice.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m sorry Lot” she whispered to her back. </p>
  
  <p>Nat got out of bed and went to the bathroom to clean up. When she returned Lottie stirred. “Natalie?”</p>
  
  <p>“Yeah Lot?” She felt her heart racing. </p>
  
  <p>“Nothing. Can you hold me please?”</p>
  
  <p>“Sure Lot.”</p>
  
  <p>She let herself succumb to sleep.</p>
